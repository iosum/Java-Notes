# switch Multiple-Selection Statement

The switch multiple-selection statement performs different actions based on the possible values of a constant integral expression of type byte, short, int or char. 

As of Java SE 7, the expression may also be a String, which we discuss in Section 5.7.


### Using a switch Statement to Count A, B, C, D and F Grades

Figure 5.9 calculates the class average of a set of numeric grades entered by the user, and uses a switch statement to determine whether each grade is the equivalent of an A, B, C,
D or F and to increment the appropriate grade counter. 

計算平均 , grades entered by the user
決定成績是 A, B, C,D or F

---

The program also displays a summary of the number of students who received each grade.

每個學生也會得到相對應的成績

---

Like earlier versions of the class-average program, the main method of class LetterGrades (Fig. 5.9) declares local variables total (line 9) and gradeCounter (line 10) to keep track of the sum of the grades entered by the user and the number of grades entered,
respectively. 

Lines 11–15 declare counter variables for each grade category. 

Note that the variables in lines 9–15 are explicitly initialized to 0.

```java
        int total = 0;
        int gradeCounter = 0;
        int aCount = 0;
        int bCount = 0;
        int cCount = 0;
        int dCount = 0;
        int eCount = 0;
        int fCount = 0;
```

Method main has two key parts. 

Lines 26–56 read an arbitrary number of integer grades from the user using sentinel-controlled repetition, update instance variables total and gradeCounter, and increment an appropriate letter-grade counter for each grade entered. 

Lines 59–80 output a report containing the total of all grades entered, the average of the grades and the number of students who received each letter grade. 

Let’s examine these parts in more detail.


![break-continue-flowchart](/img/break-continue-flowchart.jpg)


```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class LetterGrade {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int total = 0;
        int gradeCounter = 0;
        int aCount = 0;
        int bCount = 0;
        int cCount = 0;
        int dCount = 0;
        int eCount = 0;
        int fCount = 0;

        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.printf("%s%n%s%n %s%n %s%n",
        "Enter the integer grades in the range 0-100.",
        "Type the end-of-file indicator to terminate input:",
        "On UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X type <Ctrl> d then press Enter",
        "On Windows type <Ctrl> z then press Enter");


        while(in.hasNext()) {
            int grade = in.nextInt();
            total += grade;
            ++gradeCounter;

            switch(grade / 10) {
                case 9:
                case 10:
                    ++aCount;
                    break;
                
                case 8:
                    ++bCount;
                    break;
                
                case 7:
                    ++cCount;
                    break;
                
                case 6:
                    ++dCount;
                    break;
                
                default:
                    ++fCount;
                    break;

            }
        }

        System.out.printf("%nGrade Report:%n");

        if(gradeCounter != 0) {
            double average = (double) total / gradeCounter;
            System.out.printf("Total of the %d grades entered is %d%n", gradeCounter, total);
            System.out.printf("Class average is %.2f%n", average);
            System.out.printf("%n%s%n%s%d%n%s%d%n%s%d%n%s%d%n%s%d%n",
            "Number of students who received each grade:",

            "B: ", bCount, // display number of B grades
            "C: ", cCount, // display number of C grades
            "D: ", dCount, // display number of D grades
            "F: ", fCount); // display number of F grades
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("No grades were entered");
        }
    }
}
```

### Reading Grades from the User
Lines 19–23 prompt the user to enter integer grades and to type the end-of-file indicator to terminate the input. 

```java
System.out.printf("%s%n%s%n %s%n %s%n",
        "Enter the integer grades in the range 0-100.",
        "Type the end-of-file indicator to terminate input:",
        "On UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X type <Ctrl> d then press Enter",
        "On Windows type <Ctrl> z then press Enter");
```

先叫user 輸入 grade

---

The end-of-file indicator is a system-dependent keystroke combination which the user enters to indicate that there’s no more data to input. 

在code的最後面可以看到user的鍵盤指令，表示沒有 data 要input

---

In Chapter 15, Files, Streams and Object Serialization, you’ll see how the end-of-file indicator is used when a program reads its input from a file.

On UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X systems, end-of-file is entered by typing the sequence on a line by itself. 

This notation means to simultaneously press both the Ctrl key and the d key. 

在 UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X systems, 如果要 end-of-file, 要輸入 Ctrl+d

---

On Windows systems, end-of-file can be entered by typing
[Note: On some systems, you must press Enter after typing the end-of-file key sequence.

Also, Windows typically displays the characters ^Z on the screen when the end-of-file indicator is typed, as shown in the output of Fig. 5.9.]

在windows只要打 ctrl+z (有些電腦要加 enter)

---

The while statement (lines 26–56) obtains the user input. 

The condition at line 26 calls Scanner method hasNext to determine whether there’s more data to input. 

```java
while ( input.hasNext())
```
在26行可以看到 scanner method hasNext 決定有沒有更多的 data input

---

This method returns the boolean value true if there’s more data; otherwise, it returns false.

這一個 method 的回傳值是 boolean, 如果沒有data , return false, 如果還有data, return true

---


The returned value is then used as the value of the condition in the while statement.


這個 return value 用來判斷 在 while 裡面的 condition

---


Method hasNext returns false once the user types the end-of-file indicator.

method hasNext 回傳 false 表示 user 輸入 end-of-file 的指令

---

Line 28 inputs a grade value from the user. 

```java
int grade = input.nextInt();
```

拿到 user 輸入的資料

---

Line 29 adds grade to total. 

```java
total += grade;
```
把 grade 加到 total 裡面

---

Line 30 increments gradeCounter. 

```java
++gradeCounter
```

每次輸入一次 counter +1

---

These variables are used to compute the average of the grades.

這些變數被用來計算average

---

Lines 33–55 use a switch statement to increment the appropriate letter-grade counter based on the numeric grade entered.

```java
            switch(grade / 10) {
                case 9:
                case 10:
                    ++aCount;
                    break;
                
                case 8:
                    ++bCount;
                    break;
                
                case 7:
                    ++cCount;
                    break;
                
                case 6:
                    ++dCount;
                    break;
                
                default:
                    ++fCount;
                    break;

            }
```

switch 用來計算 letter grade counter，A有幾個，B有幾個...

---
### Processing the Grades
The switch statement (lines 33–55) determines which counter to increment. 

```java
            switch(grade / 10) {
                case 9:
                case 10:
                    ++aCount;
                    break;
                
                case 8:
                    ++bCount;
                    break;
                
                case 7:
                    ++cCount;
                    break;
                
                case 6:
                    ++dCount;
                    break;
                
                default:
                    ++fCount;
                    break;

            }
```

在 33-55 行這之間可以決定哪一個 counter++

---


We assume that the user enters a valid grade in the range 0–100. 

A grade in the range 90–100 represents A, 80–89 represents B, 70–79 represents C, 60–69 represents D and 0–59 represents
F. 

The switch statement consists of a block that contains a sequence of case labels and an optional default case. 

These are used in this example to determine which counter to
increment based on the grade.

When the flow of control reaches the switch, the program evaluates the expression in the parentheses (grade / 10) following keyword switch. This is the switch’s controlling expression. 

當 the flow of control 到 switch 時，program 會執行 grade/10, 這叫做 controlling expression

---

The program compares this expression’s value (which must evaluate to an integral value of type byte, char, short or int, or to a String) with each case label. 

The controlling expression in line 33 performs integer division, which truncates the fractional part of the result. 

Thus, when we divide a value from 0 to 100 by 10, the result is always a value from 0 to 10. 

當使用 0-100/10 時，結果會是從0-10(取商數))


---

We use several of these values in our case labels. 

For example, if the user enters the integer 85, the controlling expression evaluates to 8. 

當 user enter 85, controlling expression = 8

--

The switch compares 8 with each case label. 

switch 跟每一個 case label 比較

---

If a match occurs (case 8: at line 40), the program executes that
case’s statements. 

如果 match, program 會執行那一個 body 的 statement

---

For the integer 85, line 41 increments bCount, because a grade in the 80s is a B. 

如果 user 輸入的是 85, 那麼第 41 行的 bCount++

---

The break statement (line 42) causes program control to proceed with the first statement after the switch —in this program, we reach the end of the while loop, so control returns to the loop-continuation condition in line 26 to determine whether the loop should continue executing.

??? 第 42行的 break, 會讓 program 跑到 the end of while loop, 

---

The cases in our switch explicitly test for the values 10, 9, 8, 7 and 6. 

Note the cases at lines 35–36 that test for the values 9 and 10 (both of which represent the grade A). 

可以看到 35,36行 grade = "A", value 9 和 10

```java
case 9: // grade was between 90
case 10: // and 100, inclusive
    ++aCount;
break; // 
```

---

Listing cases consecutively in this manner with no statements between them enables the cases to perform the same set of statements — when the controlling expression evaluates to 9 or 10, the statements in lines 37–38 will execute. 

如果列整齊而且沒有statements, 那麼他們會執行相同的程式

---

The switch statement does not provide a mechanism for testing ranges of values, so every value you need to test must be listed in a separate case label. 

switch 並沒有提供 for testing ranges of values

---

Each case can have multiple statements. 

每一個 case 都可以有多個 statements.

---

The switch statement differs from other control statements in that it does not require braces around multiple statements in a case.

switch 跟其他 control statements 不一樣的地方在於他不需要 括弧

---

### case without a break Statement

Without break statements, each time a match occurs in the switch, the statements for that case and subsequent cases execute until a break statement or the end of the switch is encountered. 

如果沒有 break, 每一次的 match statements 跟接下來的 statements 都會被執行

---

This is often referred to as “falling through” to the statements in subsequent cases. 

這叫做 falling through

---

(This feature is perfect for writing a concise program that displays the iterative song “The Twelve Days of Christmas” in Exercise 5.29.)

---

### The default Case

If no match occurs between the controlling expression’s value and a case label, the default case (lines 52–54) executes. 

假如沒有match到，那就執行 default case

---


We use the default case in this example to process all controlling-expression values that are less than 6 — that is, all failing grades. 

在這個例子，分數只要低於 60 就會變成 F

---

If no match occurs and the switch does not contain a default case, program control simply continues with the first statement after the switch.

假如沒寫 default 又沒有 match, 那麼程式會執行第一個 statement

---

### Displaying the Grade Report

Lines 59–80 output a report based on the grades entered (as shown 
in the input/output window in Fig. 5.9). 

Line 62 determines whether the user entered at least one grade — this helps us avoid dividing by zero. 

```
gradeCounter != 0
```
決定了 user 是否至少輸入一個 grade

---

If so, line 65 calculates the average of the grades. 

如果是 
```
double average = (double) total / gradeCounter;
```
這一行就會執行

---

Lines 68–77 then output the total of all the grades, the class average and the number of students who received each letter grade. 


If no grades were entered, line 80 outputs an appropriate message. The output in Fig. 5.9 shows a sample grade report based on 10 grades.

---

### Notes on the Expression in Each case of a switch

When using the switch statement, remember that each case must contain a constant integral expression—that is, any combination of integer constants that evaluates to a constant
integer value (e.g., –7, 0 or 221)—or a String. 

使用 switch 時，要注意case 後面一定要接 integer 常數

---

An integer constant is simply an integer value. 

In addition, you can use character constants—specific characters in single quotes, such as 'A', '7' or '$'—which represent the integer values of characters and enum constants (introduced in Section 6.10). 

The expression in each case can also be a constant variable—a variable containing a value which does not change for the entire program. 

每一個 expression in each case 可以變成一個 constant variable

---

Such a variable is declared with keyword final (discussed in Chapter 6). 

這種 variable 通常都會有 keyword ```final```

---

Java has a feature called enum types, which we also
present in Chapter 6—enum type constants can also be used in case labels.
