# 6.10 Case Study: A Game of Chance; Introducing enum Types

A popular game of chance is a dice game known as craps, which is played in casinos and
back alleys throughout the world. 

The rules of the game are straightforward:

You roll two dice. 
Each die has six faces, which contain one, two, three, four, five and six spots, respectively. 
After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. 

If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win. 

第一次相加的總和是 7 或 11, 你贏

If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called “craps”), you lose (i.e., the “house” wins).

如果相加的總數是 2 或 3 或 12, 這 3 個數字叫做 craps, 表示你輸了

If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your “point.”

如果相加為 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10, 總數會變成 point

To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you “make your point” (i.e., roll that same
point value). 

想要贏就必須要再骰相同的總和

You lose by rolling a 7 before making your point.

如果骰到 7, 你就輸了

Figure 6.8 simulates the game of craps, using methods to implement the game’s logic. 

The main method (lines 21–65) calls the rollDice method (lines 68–81) as necessary to roll
the dice and compute their sum. 

The sample outputs show winning and losing on the first roll, and winning and losing on a subsequent roll.

```java
// Fig. 6.8: Craps.java
// Craps class simulates the dice game craps.
import java.security.SecureRandom;
public class Craps {
    // create secure random number generator for use in method rollDice
    private static final SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
    // enum type with constants that represent the game status
    private enum Status { CONTINUE, WON, LOST };

    // constants that represent common rolls of the dice
    private static final int SNAKE_EYES = 2;
    private static final int TREY = 3;
    private static final int SEVEN = 7;
    private static final int YO_LEVEN = 11;
    private static final int BOX_CARS = 12;
    // plays one game of craps
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myPoint = 0; // point if no win or loss on first roll
    Status gameStatus; // can contain CONTINUE, WON or LOST
    int sumOfDice = rollDice(); // first roll of the dice
    // determine game status and point based on first roll
    switch (sumOfDice) {
    case SEVEN: // win with 7 on first roll
    case YO_LEVEN: // win with 11 on first roll
        gameStatus = Status.WON;
        break;
    case SNAKE_EYES: // lose with 2 on first roll
    case TREY: // lose with 3 on first roll
    case BOX_CARS: // lose with 12 on first roll
        gameStatus = Status.LOST;
        break;
    default: // did not win or lose, so remember point
        gameStatus = Status.CONTINUE; // game is not over
        myPoint = sumOfDice; // remember the point
        System.out.printf("Point is %d%n", myPoint);
        break;
    }
    while (gameStatus == Status.CONTINUE ) // not WON or LOST
    {
        sumOfDice = rollDice(); // roll dice again
    // determine game status
        if (sumOfDice == myPoint) // win by making point
            gameStatus = Status.WON;
        else if (sumOfDice == SEVEN) // lose by rolling 7 before point
            gameStatus = Status.LOST;
    }
    gameStatus == Status.CONTINUE
    gameStatus = Status.WON
    gameStatus = Status.LOST;
    // display won or lost message
    if (gameStatus == Status.WON )
        System.out.println("Player wins");
    else
        System.out.println("Player loses");
    }
    // roll dice, calculate sum and display results
    public static int rollDice(){
    // pick random die values
    int die1 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // first die roll
    int die2 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // second die roll
    int sum = die1 + die2; // sum of die values
    // display results of this roll
    System.out.printf("Player rolled %d + %d = %d%n",
    die1, die2, sum);
    return sum;
    }
} // end class Craps
```
### Method rollDice
In the rules of the game, the player must roll two dice on the first and all subsequent rolls.
We declare method ```rollDice``` (lines 68–81) to roll the dice and compute and print their
sum. 

```java
    int die1 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // first die roll
    int die2 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // second die roll
```

Method ```rollDice``` is declared once, but it’s called from two places (lines 26 and 50)
in main, which contains the logic for one complete game of craps. 

```java
    int sumOfDice = rollDice(); // first roll of the dice
    sumOfDice = rollDice(); // roll dice again
```

Method rollDice takes no arguments, so it has an empty parameter list. 

Each time it’s called, ```rollDice``` returns the sum of the dice, so the return type int is indicated in the method header (line 68).

```rollDice``` 回傳dice的總和


```java
    public static int rollDice(){
```

Although lines 71 and 72 look the same (except for the die names), they do not necessarily
produce the same result. 

```java
    int die1 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // first die roll
    int die2 = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // second die roll
```

Each of these statements produces a random value in the range 1–6.

可以產生 1,2,3,4,5,6 的數字


Variable ```randomNumbers``` (used in lines 71–72) is not declared in the method. 

```randomNumbers``` 並沒有定義在 method 裡面

Instead it’s declared as a private static final variable of the class and initialized in line 8.

而是直接在 class 的時候直接定義了

This enables us to create one ```SecureRandom``` object that’s reused in each call to ```rollDice```. 

If there were a program that contained multiple instances of class Craps, they’d all share this one
```SecureRandom``` object.

如果有很多的 instances, 就可以用相同的 class 去呼叫這一個 ```SecureRandom```


### Method main’s Local Variables

The game is reasonably involved. 

The player may win or lose on the first roll, or may win or lose on any subsequent roll. 

Method main (lines 21–65) uses local variable ```myPoint``` (line 23) to store the “point” if the player doesn’t win or lose on the first roll, local variable
```gameStatus``` (line 24) to keep track of the overall game status and local variable ```sumOfDice```
(line 26) to hold the sum of the dice for the most recent roll. 

```myPoint``` 是 local 變數, 用來存 point

```gameStatus``` 是用來判斷整體的遊戲情況

```sumOfDice``` 是用來存最近一次骰子的總和



Variable ```myPoint``` is initialized to 0 to ensure that the application will compile.

```myPoint``` 設為 0, 可以確保 program 可以執行


If you do not initialize ```myPoint```, the compiler issues an error, because ```myPoint``` is not assigned a value in every case of the switch statement, and thus the program could try to use ```myPoint``` before it’s assigned a value. 

```myPoint``` 如果沒有初始化,會有 compile error

By contrast, ```gameStatus``` is assigned a value in every case of the switch statement (including
the default case) — thus, it’s guaranteed to be initialized before it’s used, so we do not
need to initialize it in line 24.


### enum Type Status
Local variable ```gameStatus``` (line 24) is declared to be of a new type called ```Status``` (declared
at line 11). 

Type ```Status``` is a private member of class ```Craps```, because ```Status``` will be used only in that class. 

因為 Status 只會用在 Craps 這一個 class, 所以定義成 private

```Status``` is a type called an ```enum``` type, which, in its simplest form, declares a set of constants represented by identifiers. 

enum: 是用來宣告常數

An enum type is a special kind of class that’s introduced by the keyword enum and a type name (in this case, Status). 

As with classes, braces delimit an enum declaration’s body. 

Inside the braces is a comma-separated list of enum constants, each representing a unique value. 

The identifiers in an enum must be unique. 

Variables of type Status can be assigned only the three constants declared in the enum
(line 11) or a compilation error will occur. 

When the game is won, the program sets local variable gameStatus to ```Status.WON``` (lines 33 and 54). 

When the game is lost, the program sets local variable gameStatus to ```Status.LOST``` (lines 38 and 57). 

Otherwise, the program sets local variable gameStatus to ```Status.CONTINUE``` (line 41) to indicate that the game is not over and the dice must be rolled again.



#### Good Programming Practice 6.1
Use only uppercase letters in the names of enum constants to make them stand out and remind you that they’re not variables.

使用大寫可以提醒自己這一個不是 variable 而是 enum constants


#### Good Programming Practice 6.2
Using enum constants (like Status.WON, Status.LOST and Status.CONTINUE) rather
than literal values (such as 0, 1 and 2) makes programs easier to read and maintain.

使用文字寫而不是 1,2,3可以讓 program 的可讀性更高

### Logic of the main Method

Line 26 in main calls ```rollDice```, which picks two random values from 1 to 6, displays the
values of the first die, the second die and their sum, and returns the sum. 

```java
int sumOfDice = rollDice(); // first roll of the dice
```

Method main next enters the switch statement (lines 29–45), which uses the ```sumOfDice``` value from line 26 to determine whether the game has been won or lost, or should continue with another
roll. 

The values that result in a win or loss on the first roll are declared as private static
final int constants in lines 14–18. 

The identifier names use casino parlance for these sums. 

These constants, like enum constants, are declared by convention with all capital letters, to make them stand out in the program. 

Lines 31–34 determine whether the player won on the first roll with ```SEVEN``` (7) or ```YO_LEVEN``` (11). 

Lines 35–39 determine whether the player lost on the first roll with ```SNAKE_EYES``` (2), ```TREY``` (3), or ```BOX_CARS``` (12). 

After the first roll, if the game is not over, the default case (lines 40–44) sets ```gameStatus``` to ```Status.CONTINUE```, saves ```sumOfDice``` in ```myPoint``` and displays the point.


If we’re still trying to “make our point” (i.e., the game is continuing from a prior roll),
lines 48–58 execute. 

Line 50 rolls the dice again. 

If ```sumOfDice``` matches ```myPoint``` (line 53), line 54 sets ```gameStatus``` to ```Status.WON```, then the loop terminates because the game is complete. 

假如 ```sumOfDice``` 跟 ```myPoint``` 一樣，那麼 ```gameStatus``` 就會變成 ```Status.WON```, 然後迴圈終止

If ```sumOfDice``` is ```SEVEN``` (line 56), line 57 sets ```gameStatus``` to ```Status.LOST```, and the loop terminates because the game is complete. 

假如 ```sumOfDice``` 是 ```SEVEN```, ```gameStatus``` 就會變成 ```Status.LOST```, 迴圈終止

When the game completes, lines 61–64 display a message indicating whether the player won or lost, and the program terminates.


The program uses the various program - control mechanisms we’ve discussed. 

The Craps class uses two methods — main and rollDice (called twice from main)—and the
switch, while, if…else and nested if control statements. 

Note also the use of multiple
case labels in the switch statement to execute the same statements for sums of SEVEN and
YO_LEVEN (lines 31–32) and for sums of SNAKE_EYES, TREY and BOX_CARS (lines 35–37)


### Why Some Constants Are Not Defined as enum Constants
You might be wondering why we declared the sums of the dice as private static final
int constants rather than as enum constants. 

為甚麼不把骰子的 sum 定義成 enum?

The reason is that the program must compare the int variable ```sumOfDice``` (line 26) to these constants to determine the outcome of each roll. 

因為要先跟 ```sumOfDice``` 去做比較, 才決定出 outcome 是甚麼

Suppose we declared enum Sum containing constants (e.g., Sum.SNAKE_EYES) representing the five sums used in the game, then used these constants in the switch statement (lines
29–45). 



Doing so would prevent us from using sumOfDice as the switch statement’s controlling expression, because Java does not allow an int to be compared to an enum constant.


如果定義成 enum type, java 會不允許我們這麼做, 因為 switch 裡面比較的 data type 一個是 int, 另外一個是 enum

To achieve the same functionality as the current program, we would have to use a variable
```currentSum``` of type Sum as the switch’s controlling expression. 

為了要達到 program 的效果, 必須要用一個 currentSum 代表 switch 的 control expression

Unfortunately, Java does not provide an easy way to convert an int value to a particular enum constant. 

java 目前沒有提供簡單的方式能讓 int 轉成 enum

This could be done with a separate switch statement. 

This would be cumbersome and would not improve the program’s readability (thus defeating the purpose of using an enum).
