# 6.3 static Methods, static Fields and Class Math

Although most methods execute in response to method calls on specific objects, this is not
always the case. 

Sometimes a method performs a task that does not depend on an object.

有時候 a method perform a task 並不需要 object 

--- 

Such a method applies to the class in which it’s declared as a whole and is known as a static method or a class method.

這種 method 會有一個 class has a ```static``` or a ```class``` method

---

It’s common for classes to contain convenient static methods to perform common
tasks. 

這是常見的

---

For example, recall that we used static method pow of class Math to raise a value to
a power in Fig. 5.6. 

假如現在用 ```pow()``` 這一個 method

---

To declare a method as static, place the keyword ```static``` before the
return type in the method’s declaration. 

keyword: ```static``` to declare a method

---

For any class imported into your program, you
can call the class’s static methods by specifying the name of the class in which the
method is declared, followed by a dot (.) and the method name, as in

```
ClassName.methodName(arguments)
```
不用再用 ```ClassName variableName = new ClassName();```


### 優點 : 
convenience

### Math Class Methods
We use various Math class methods here to present the concept of static methods. 

Class Math provides a collection of methods that enable you to perform common mathematical
calculations. 


For example, you can calculate the square root of 900.0 with the static method call

```
Math.sqrt(900.0)
```
算根號


This expression evaluates to 30.0. 

Method sqrt takes an argument of type ```double``` and returns a result of type ```double```. 

傳入 ```double```, return ```double```

---

To output the value of the preceding method call in the command window, you might write the statement

```
System.out.println(Math.sqrt(900.0));
```

印出來

---

In this statement, the value that sqrt returns becomes the argument to method println.

sqrt value 會變成 argument in method println

---

There was no need to create a Math object before calling method sqrt. 

不用再 create object

---

Also all Math class methods are static — therefore, each is called by preceding its name with the class name
Math and the dot (.) separator.

全部的 Math Class methods 都是 static

---

#### Software Engineering Observation 6.4
Class Math is part of the java.lang package, which is implicitly imported by the compiler,
so it’s not necessary to import class Math to use its methods.

math class 已經在 java.lang 當中，不用再 import

---

Method arguments may be constants, variables or expressions. 

If c = 13.0, d = 3.0 and f = 4.0, then the statement

```
System.out.println(Math.sqrt(c + d * f));
```
calculates and prints the square root of 13.0 + 3.0 * 4.0 = 25.0

namely, 5.0. 

Figure 6.2 summarizes several Math class methods. 

In the figure, x and y are of type double.


### static Variables
Recall from Section 3.2 that each object of a class maintains its own copy of every instance
variable of the class. 

每一個 object of a class 都會要 instance variable

---

There are variables for which each object of a class does not need its
own separate copy (as you’ll see momentarily). 

有些不用

---

Such variables are declared static and are also known as class variables. 

例如 static (class) variable

---

When objects of a class containing static variables are created, all the objects of that class share one copy of those variables. 

只要有一個 static variable 就可以，他就可以 share variable

---

Together a class’s static variables and instance variables are known as its ```fields```.

---

### Math Class static Constants PI and E
Class Math declares two constants, Math.PI and Math.E, that represent high-precision approximations to commonly used mathematical constants. 

Math.PI (3.141592653589793) is the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. 

Math.E (2.718281828459045) is the base value for natural logarithms (calculated with static Math method log). 

Math.E = log2

---

These constants are declared in class Math with the modifiers public,final and static. 

這些都是存在 ```public```, ```final``` and ```static```

---

Making them public allows you to use them in your own classes. 

可以讓外面的人用

---

Any field declared with keyword final is constant—its value cannot change after the field is initialized. 

```final``` : 常數(永遠不變), 已經終止

---

Making these fields static allows them to be accessed via the class name Math and a dot (.) separator, just as
class Math’s methods are.

static : 可以用 ```className.methodName``` access
