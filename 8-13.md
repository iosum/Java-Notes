# 8.13 final Instance Variables
The principle of least privilege is fundamental to good software engineering. 


In the context of an app’s code, it states that code should be granted only the amount of privilege
and access that it needs to accomplish its designated task, but no more. 



This makes your
programs more robust by preventing code from accidentally (or maliciously) modifying
variable values and calling methods that should not be accessible.



Let’s see how this principle applies to instance variables.


Some of them need to be modifiable and some do not. 


You can use the keyword `final` to specify that a variable is
not modifiable (i.e., it’s a constant) and that any attempt to modify it is an error. 

- final means a variable is not modifiable (it's a constant)
- any attempt to modify it is an error


For example,

```java
private final int INCREMENT;
```

declares a `final` (constant) instance variable `INCREMENT` of type int. 


Such variables can be initialized when they’re declared. 

- `final` variable can be initialized when they're declared


If they’re not, they must be initialized in every constructor of the class. 

- they must initialized in every constructor of the class 


Initializing constants in constructors enables each object of the class to have
a different value for the constant. 

- initializing constants in constructors
- can allow each object to have a different value


If a `final` variable is not initialized in its declaration or in every constructor, a compilation error occurs.

- if it is not initialized, a compilation error occurs


#### Software Engineering Observation 8.11
Declaring an instance variable as `final` helps enforce the principle of least privilege. If an
instance variable should not be modified, declare it to be `final` to prevent modification.
For example, in Fig. 8.8, the instance variables `firstName`, `lastName`, `birthDate` and
`hireDate` are never modified after they’re initialized, so they should be declared `final`.
We’ll enforce this practice in all programs going forward. You’ll see additional benefits of
final in Chapter 23, Concurrency.

#### Common Programming Error 8.8
Attempting to modify a `final` instance variable after it’s initialized is a compilation error.


#### Error-Prevention Tip 8.5
Attempts to modify a final instance variable are caught at compilation time rather than
causing execution-time errors. It’s always preferable to get bugs out at compilation time,
if possible, rather than allow them to slip through to execution time (where experience has
found that repair is often many times more expensive).


#### Software Engineering Observation 8.12
A `final` field should also be declared `static` if it’s initialized in its declaration to a value
that’s the same for all objects of the class. After this initialization, its value can never
change. Therefore, we don’t need a separate copy of the field for every object of the class.
Making the field static enables all objects of the class to share the final field.
