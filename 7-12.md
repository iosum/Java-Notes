# 7.12 Case Study: Class GradeBook Using a TwoDimensional Array

In Section 7.10, we presented class ```GradeBook``` (Fig. 7.14), which used a one-dimensional
array to store student grades on a single exam. 

In most semesters, students take several exams. Professors are likely to want to analyze grades across the entire semester, both for a single student and for the class as a whole.


Storing Student Grades in a Two-Dimensional Array in Class ```GradeBook``` Figure 7.18 contains a ```GradeBook``` class that uses a two-dimensional array grades to store the grades of several students on multiple exams. 

Each row of the array represents a single student’s grades for the entire course, and each column represents the grades of all the students who took a particular exam. 

Class ```GradeBookTest``` (Fig. 7.19) passes the array as an argument to the ```GradeBook``` constructor. 

In this example, we use a ten-by-three array for ten students’ grades on three exams. 

10x3 array

Five methods perform array manipulations to process the grades. 

Each method is similar to its counterpart in the earlier one-dimensional array version of ```GradeBook``` (Fig. 7.14). 

Method ```getMinimum``` (lines 46–62) determines the lowest grade of any student for the semester. 

```java
// find minimum grade
public int getMinimum()
{
    // assume first element of grades array is smallest
    int lowGrade = grades[0][0];
    // loop through rows of grades array
    for (int[] studentGrades : grades) {
    // loop through columns of current row
        for (int grade : studentGrades) {
            // if grade less than lowGrade, assign it to lowGrade
            if (grade < lowGrade)
                lowGrade = grade;
        }
    }
    return lowGrade;
}
```


Method ```getMaximum``` (lines 65–83) determines the
highest grade of any student for the semester. 

```java
// find maximum grade
public int getMaximum()
{
    // assume first element of grades array is largest
    int highGrade = grades[0][0];
        // loop through rows of grades array
    for (int[] studentGrades : grades) {
        // loop through columns of current row
        for (int grade : studentGrades) {
        // if grade greater than highGrade, assign it to highGrade
            if (grade > highGrade)
            highGrade = grade;
        }
    }
    return highGrade;
}
```

Method ```getAverage``` (lines 86–96) determines a particular student’s semester average. 

總平均 = 總成績 / 個數

```java
// determine average grade for particular set of grades
public double getAverage(int[] setOfGrades)
{
    int total = 0;
    // sum grades for one student
    for (int grade : setOfGrades)
        total += grade;
    // return average of grades
    return (double) total / setOfGrades.length;
}
```


Method ```outputBarChart``` (lines 99–129) out puts a grade bar chart for the entire semester’s student grades. 

第一個雙層迴圈先算出 frequency, 下面的再用 frequency 把星星印出來

```java
// output bar chart displaying overall grade distribution
public void outputBarChart()
{
    System.out.println("Overall grade distribution:");
    // stores frequency of grades in each range of 10 grades
    int[] frequency = new int[11];

    // for each grade in GradeBook, increment the appropriate frequency
    for (int[] studentGrades : grades) {
        for (int grade : studentGrades)
            ++frequency[grade / 10];
    }

    // for each grade frequency, print bar in chart
    for (int count = 0; count < frequency.length; count++) {

        // output bar label ("00-09: ", ..., "90-99: ", "100: ")
        if (count == 10)
            System.out.printf("%5d: ", 100);
        else
            System.out.printf("%02d-%02d: ", count * 10, count * 10 + 9);

        // print bar of asterisks
        for (int stars = 0; stars < frequency[count]; stars++)
            System.out.print("*");
    
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```


Method ```outputGrades``` (lines 132–156) outputs the array in a tabular format, along with each student’s semester average.

```java
// output the contents of the grades array
public void outputGrades()
{
    
    System.out.printf("The grades are:%n%n");
    System.out.print(" "); // align column heads
    
    // create a column heading for each of the tests
    for (int test = 0; test < grades[0].length; test++)
        System.out.printf("Test %d ", test + 1);

    System.out.println("Average"); // student average column heading
    
    // create rows/columns of text representing array grades
        for (int student = 0; student < grades.length; student++) {
        
            System.out.printf("Student %2d", student + 1);

            for (int test : grades[student]) // output student's grades
                System.out.printf("%8d", test);
            // call method getAverage to calculate student's average grade;
            // pass row of grades as the argument to getAverage
            
            
            double average = getAverage(grades[student]);
            
            System.out.printf("%9.2f%n", average);
            
        }
} // end class GradeBook
```

### Methods getMinimum and getMaximum
Methods ```getMinimum```, ```getMaximum```, ```outputBarChart``` and ```outputGrades``` each loop
through array grades by using nested for statements—for example, the nested enhanced
for statement (lines 50–59) from the declaration of method ```getMinimum```. 


The outer enhanced for statement iterates through the two-dimensional array grades, assigning successive rows to parameter ```studentGrades``` on successive iterations. 

```java
    for (int[] studentGrades : grades) {
    // loop through columns of current row
        for (int grade : studentGrades) {
            // if grade less than lowGrade, assign it to lowGrade
            if (grade < lowGrade)
                lowGrade = grade;
        }
    }
```

外層的由左往右走, 內層的由上往下走, 所以最後走的結果是第一列固定, 先走完第一行,第一行走完後, 再換第二列, 第二列固定, 再往下走第二行



The square brackets following the parameter name indicate that ```studentGrades``` refers to a one-dimensional int array—namely, a row in array grades containing one student’s grades. 

```studentGrades``` 是一個矩陣


To find the lowest overall grade, the inner for statement compares the elements of the current onedimensional array ```studentGrades``` to variable lowGrade. 


For example, on the first iteration of the outer for, row 0 of grades is assigned to parameter ```studentGrades```. 

The inner enhanced for statement then loops through ```studentGrades``` and compares each grade value
with ```lowGrade```. 


If a grade is less than ```lowGrade```, ```lowGrade``` is set to that grade. 


On the second iteration of the outer enhanced for statement, row 1 of grades is assigned to ```studentGrades```, and the elements of this row are compared with variable ```lowGrade```. 

This repeats until all rows of grades have been traversed. 


When execution of the nested statement is complete, lowGrade contains the lowest grade in the two-dimensional array.


Method ```getMaximum``` works similarly to method ```getMinimum```.


### Method outputBarChart
Method ```outputBarChart``` in Fig. 7.18 is nearly identical to the one in Fig. 7.14. 

However, to output the overall grade distribution for a whole semester, the method here uses nested
enhanced for statements (lines 107–111) to create the one-dimensional array frequency based on all the grades in the two-dimensional array. 

```java
    // for each grade in GradeBook, increment the appropriate frequency
    for (int[] studentGrades : grades) {
        for (int grade : studentGrades)
            ++frequency[grade / 10];
    }
```

The rest of the code in each of the two ```outputBarChart``` methods that displays the chart is identical.


### Method outputGrades

Method ```outputGrades``` (lines 132–156) uses nested for statements to output values of the array grades and each student’s semester average. 

The output (Fig. 7.19) shows the result, which resembles the tabular format of a professor’s physical grade book. 

Lines 138–139 print the column headings for each test. 

印 column , 終止條件是 ```row[0].length```


```java
    // create a column heading for each of the tests
    for (int test = 0; test < grades[0].length; test++)
        System.out.printf("Test %d ", test + 1);
```


We use a counter-controlled for statement here so that we can identify each test with a number. 

Similarly, the for statement in lines 144–155 first outputs a row label using a counter variable to identify each student (line 146).

第一個終止條件就是矩陣的長度
第二個終止條件是 row 矩陣的長度


```java
   // create rows/columns of text representing array grades
        for (int student = 0; student < grades.length; student++) {
        
            System.out.printf("Student %2d", student + 1);

            for (int test : grades[student]) // output student's grades
                System.out.printf("%8d", test);
            
            // call method getAverage to calculate student's average grade;
            // pass row of grades as the argument to getAverage
            double average = getAverage(grades[student]);
            
            System.out.printf("%9.2f%n", average);
            
        }
```


Although array indices start at 0, lines 139 and 146 output ```test + 1``` and ```student + 1```, respectively, to produce test and student numbers starting at 1 (see the output in Fig. 7.19).


The inner for statement (lines 148–149) uses the outer for statement’s counter variable
student to loop through a specific row of array grades and output each student’s test
grade. 

```grades[student]``` 表示指定哪一個 row(-)

```java
for (int test : grades[student]) // output student's grades
    System.out.printf("%8d", test);
```

An enhanced for statement can be nested in a counter-controlled for statement, and vice versa. 

Finally, line 153 obtains each student’s semester average by passing the current row of grades (i.e., ```grades[student]```) to method ```getAverage```.



### Method getAverage
Method ```getAverage``` (lines 86–96) takes one argument—a one-dimensional array of test
results for a particular student. 


When line 153 calls ```getAverage```, the argument is ```grades[student]```, which specifies that a particular row of the two-dimensional array grades should be passed to ```getAverage```. 


For example, based on the array created in Fig. 7.19, the argument ```grades[1]``` represents the three values (a one-dimensional array of grades) stored in row 1 of the two-dimensional array grades. 


```grades[1]``` 指的是把第一列矩陣的值 

Recall that a two-dimensional array is one whose elements are one-dimensional arrays. 


Method ```getAverage``` calculates the sum of the array elements, divides the total by the number of test results and returns the floating-point result as a double value (line 95).

### Class GradeBookTest That Demonstrates Class GradeBook
Figure 7.19 creates an object of class ```GradeBook``` (Fig. 7.18) using the two-dimensional array of ints named ```gradesArray``` (declared and initialized in lines 10–19). 

Lines 21–22 pass a course name and ```gradesArray``` to the ```GradeBook``` constructor. 

```java
GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook("CS101 Introduction to Java Programming", gradesArray);
```


Lines 23–24 display a welcome message containing the course name, then line 25 invokes ```myGradeBook’s``` ```processGrades``` method to display a report summarizing the students’ grades for the semester.

```java
System.out.printf("Welcome to the grade book for%n%s%n%n", myGradeBook.getCourseName());
myGradeBook.processGrades();
```



```java
// Fig. 7.19: GradeBookTest.java
// GradeBookTest creates GradeBook object using a two-dimensional array
// of grades, then invokes method processGrades to analyze them.
public class GradeBookTest
{
// main method begins program execution
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    // two-dimensional array of student grades
        int[][] gradesArray = {{87, 96, 70},
                                {68, 87, 90},
                                {94, 100, 90},
                                {100, 81, 82},
                                {83, 65, 85},
                                {78, 87, 65},
                                {85, 75, 83},
                                {91, 94, 100},
                                {76, 72, 84},
                                {87, 93, 73}};
        GradeBook myGradeBook = new GradeBook("CS101 Introduction to Java Programming", gradesArray);
        System.out.printf("Welcome to the grade book for%n%s%n%n", myGradeBook.getCourseName());
        myGradeBook.processGrades();
    }
} // end class GradeBookTest
