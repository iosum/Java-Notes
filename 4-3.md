# Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an informal language that helps you develop algorithms without having to
worry about the strict details of Java language syntax. 

Pseudocode 是非正式的語言，只是幫助你 develop algorithm, 並不用注意 java 語法 detail

The pseudocode we present is particularly useful for developing algorithms that will be converted to structured portions of Java programs. 

The pseudocode we use in this book is similar to everyday English — it’s
convenient and user friendly, but it’s not an actual computer programming language.

You’ll see an algorithm written in pseudocode in Fig. 4.7. 

You may, of course, use your own native language(s) to develop your own pseudocode.

Pseudocode does not execute on computers. 

Pseudocode 不在電腦上執行

Rather, it helps you “think out” a program before attempting to write it in a programming language, such as Java. 

只是幫助你想步驟跟方法在寫程式之前

This chapter provides several examples of using pseudocode to develop Java programs.

The style of pseudocode we present consists purely of characters, so you can type
pseudocode conveniently, using any text-editor program. 

A carefully prepared pseudocode program can easily be converted to a corresponding Java program.

寫得好的 pseudocode 可以被轉換成 java 語言

Pseudocode normally describes only statements representing the actions that occur
after you convert a program from pseudocode to Java and the program is run on a computer. 

Pseudocode 通常描述已發生的 statement，把 program 變成 java 後就可以在電腦上面執行

Such actions might include input, output or calculations. 

action: input/output/計算

In our pseudocode, we typically do not include variable declarations, but some programmers choose to list variables and mention their purposes.
