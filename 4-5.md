# if Single-Selection Statement

Programs use selection statements to choose among alternative courses of action. 

For example, suppose that the passing grade on an exam is 60. 

The pseudocode statement

```
If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60
    Print “Passed”
```
determines whether the condition “student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60” is true. 

If so, “Passed” is printed, and the next pseudocode statement in order is “performed.”


如果成績大於 60, condition==true, 那麼會 print

---


(Remember, pseudocode is not a real programming language.) 

pseudocode 不是真的 programming language

---

If the condition is false, the
Print statement is ignored, and the next pseudocode statement in order is performed. 



if condition == false, print 會被 ignored

---


The indentation of the second line of this selection statement is optional, but recommended,
because it emphasizes the inherent structure of structured programs.


建議要indentation

The preceding pseudocode If statement may be written in Java as

```java
if (studentGrade >= 60)
    System.out.println("Passed");
```

寫成 java 就可以變成上述這個 code

The Java code corresponds closely to the pseudocode. 

This is one of the properties of
pseudocode that makes it such a useful program development tool.
