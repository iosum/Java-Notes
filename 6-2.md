# Program Modules in Java

You write Java programs by combining new methods and classes with predefined ones available in the Java Application Programming Interface (also referred to as the Java API or Java class library) and in various other class libraries.

現在 write java program 是用 method 和 classes 結合起來，這些 classes 和 method 是之前別人寫好的 ，在 Java 的 API 裡面

---

Related classes are typically grouped into packages so that they can be imported into programs and reused. 

各個相關的 classes 會被包裝成 packeges 這樣就可以被 imported 到 programs and reused

---

The Java API provides a rich collection of predefined classes that contain methods for performing common mathematical calculations, string manipulations, character manipulations, input/output operations, database operations, networking operations, file processing, error checking and
more.

### Divide and Conquer with Classes and Methods

Classes and methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units. 

The statements in the method bodies are written only once, are hidden from other methods and can be reused from several locations in a program.

classes and methods 幫你 modularize a program, 把 seperating tasks to self-contained, statement 只會被寫一次而且會被 hidden from other method

---

One motivation for modularizing a program into classes and methods is the divide and-conquer approach, which makes program development more manageable by constructing programs from small, simple pieces. 

modularizing a program 使用的是 devide and conquer, 切成小碎片各個擊破

---

Another is software reusability — using existing classes and methods as building blocks to create new programs. 

另外一個是軟體重複使用，使用已知的 classes and methods to create new programs

---

Often, you can create programs mostly from existing classes and methods rather than by building customized code. 

For example, in earlier programs, we did not define how to read data from the keyboard — Java provides these capabilities in the methods of class Scanner. 

A third motivation is to avoid repeating code. 

另外的一個是避免寫重複的 code

---

Dividing a program into meaningful classes and methods makes the program easier to debug and maintain.

把 program 切成很多塊可以 easier to debug and maintain

### Hierarchical Relationship Between Method Calls

As you know, a method is invoked by a method call, and when the called method completes its task, it returns control and possibly a result to the caller.

a method 是被 a method call 所 invoked, 當 method 完成他的任務時，他會回傳可能的結果給 caller

---

An analogy to this program structure is the hierarchical form of management (Fig. 6.1). 

![fig-6.1](/img/fig_6.1.png)

A boss (the caller) asks a worker (the called method) to perform a task and report back (return) the results after completing the task. 

在這邊 caller 是 boss(使用函數), asks a worker (被 called 的 method), to perform a test, 然後繳交報告回來

---

The boss method does not know how the worker method performs its designated tasks. 

boss 並不知道 worker 是怎麼完成任務的

---

The worker may also call other worker methods, unbeknown to the boss. 

worker 可以 call other worker 去做任務且 boss 也不會知道

---

This “hiding” of implementation details promotes good software engineering.

hiding 是可以幫助 software engineering的

---

Figure 6.1 shows the boss method communicating with several worker methods in a hierarchical manner. 

The boss method divides its responsibilities among the various worker methods. 

Here, worker1 acts as a “boss method” to worker4 and worker5.

在這裡 worker1 會被視為是 worker4 and worker5 的 boss
