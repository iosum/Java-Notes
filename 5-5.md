# do…while Repetition Statement

The do…while repetition statement is similar to the while statement. 

In the while, the program tests the loop-continuation condition at the beginning of the loop, before executing the loop’s body; 

if the condition is false, the body never executes. 

The do…while statement tests the loop-continuation condition after executing the loop’s body; 

do...while 先執行 loop body 之後再判斷

---

therefore, the body always executes at least once. 

因此 body 至少執行一次

---

When a do…while statement terminates, execution continues with the next statement in sequence. 

Figure 5.7 uses a do…while to output the numbers 1–10.


```java
public class DoWhileTest {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int counter = 1;
        do {
            System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
            ++counter;
        } while (counter <= 10); // end do...while

        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
Line 8 declares and initializes control variable counter.
```java
int counter = 1;
```
宣告變數 counter = 1;

---

Upon entering the do…while statement, line 12 outputs counter’s value and line 13 increments counter. 

```java
System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
```
第12行輸出counter的值

```java
++counter;
```
13 行 counter++

---

Then the program evaluates the loop-continuation test at the bottom of the loop (line 14). 

```java
while (counter <= 10); // end do...while
```
判斷 loop condition

---

If the condition is true, the loop continues at the first body statement (line 12). 

如果 condition == true;
繼續執行第12行
```java
System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
```

---

If the condition is false, the loop terminates and the program continues at the next statement after the loop

如果 condition == false, 那麼就跳出 loop
