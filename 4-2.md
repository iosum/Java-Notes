# Algorithm

Any computing problem can be solved by executing a series of actions in a specific order.

A procedure for solving a problem in terms of

1. the actions to execute and

2. the order in which these actions execute

is called an algorithm. 

algorithm = the action to execute + the order in which action execute
algorithm = 要執行的東西 + 先後順序

The following example demonstrates that correctly specifying the order in which the actions execute is important.

Consider the “rise-and-shine algorithm” followed by one executive for getting out of
bed and going to work: 
(1) Get out of bed; 
(2) take off pajamas; 
(3) take a shower; 
(4) get dressed; 
(5) eat breakfast; 
(6) carpool to work. 

This routine gets the executive to work well
prepared to make critical decisions. 

Suppose that the same steps are performed in a slightly
different order: 
(1) Get out of bed; 
(2) take off pajamas; 
(3) get dressed; 
(4) take a shower;
(5) eat breakfast; 
(6) carpool to work. 

In this case, our executive shows up for work soaking wet. 

Specifying the order in which statements (actions) execute in a program is called program control. 

指定 statement 執行的順序叫做 program control

This chapter investigates program control using Java’s control statements.
