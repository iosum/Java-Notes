# 6.12 Method Overloading

Methods of the same name can be declared in the same class, as long as they have different
sets of parameters (determined by the number, types and order of the parameters)—this
is called method overloading. 

相同的 method name 可以在 same class, 只要 parameters 不同就可以, 這樣就叫做 method overloading

When an overloaded method is called, the compiler selects
the appropriate method by examining the number, types and order of the arguments in
the call. 

當有一個 overloaded method 被呼叫的時候, compiler 會選擇最符合他的 method

Method overloading is commonly used to create several methods with the same
name that perform the same or similar tasks, but on different types or different numbers of
arguments. 

method overloading 通常用在 create 很多相同的 method name 但是 perform 不太一樣的 tasks, different numbers of arguments

For example, Math methods abs, min and max (summarized in Section 6.3) are
overloaded with four versions each:

1. One with two ```double``` parameters.
2. One with two ```float``` parameters.
3. One with two ```int``` parameters.
4. One with two ```long``` parameters.

Our next example demonstrates declaring and invoking overloaded methods. 

We demonstrate overloaded constructors in Chapter 8.


### Declaring Overloaded Methods
Class ```MethodOverload``` (Fig. 6.10) includes two overloaded versions of method square—
one that calculates the square of an int (and returns an int) and one that calculates the
square of a double (and returns a double). 

有 2 個 overloaded method: 
第一個 argument int, return data type 是 int
第二個是 argrment double, return data type 是 double

Although these methods have the same name and similar parameter lists and bodies, think of them simply as different methods. 

It may help to think of the method names as “square of int” and “square of double,” respectively.

```java
// Fig. 6.10: MethodOverload.java
// Overloaded method declarations.
public class MethodOverload
{
    // test overloaded square methods
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.printf("Square of integer 7 is %d%n", square(7));
        System.out.printf("Square of double 7.5 is %f%n", square(7.5));
    }
// square method with int argument
    public static int square(int intValue)
    {
        System.out.printf("%nCalled square with int argument: %d%n",
        intValue);
        return intValue * intValue;
    }
// square method with double argument
    public static double square(double doubleValue)
    {
        System.out.printf("%nCalled square with double argument: %f%n",
        doubleValue);
        return doubleValue * doubleValue;
    }
} // end class MethodOverload
```

Line 9 invokes method square with the argument 7. 

```java
System.out.printf("Square of integer 7 is %d%n", square(7));
```
Literal integer values are treated as type int, so the method call in line 9 invokes the version of square at lines 14–19 that specifies an int parameter. 

因為當初放入的 data type 是 int, 所以呼叫的 method 也是 int 的 parameter

```java
    public static int square(int intValue)
    {
        System.out.printf("%nCalled square with int argument: %d%n",
        intValue);
        return intValue * intValue;
    }
```

Similarly, line 10 invokes method square with the argument 7.5. 

Literal floating-point values are treated as type double, so the method call in line 10
invokes the version of square at lines 22–27 that specifies a double parameter. 

所以如果放入的 data type 是 double, 也會 call method argument 是 double


Each method first outputs a line of text to prove that the proper method was called in each case.

The values in lines 10 and 24 are displayed with the format specifier ```%f```. 

使用 format specifer: ```%f```

We did not specify a precision in either case. 

By default, floating-point values are displayed with six digits of precision if the precision is not specified in the format specifier.

floating-point 的精準度是 6 個小數點


### Distinguishing Between Overloaded Methods
The compiler distinguishes overloaded methods by their signatures — a combination of the
method’s name and the number, types and order of its parameters, ***but not its return type***. 

compiler 分辨 overloaded method 是利用 method's name, number, 參數的 types, orders, 但是並不是 return type

If the compiler looked only at method names during compilation, the code in Fig. 6.10 would
be ambiguous — the compiler would not know how to distinguish between the two square
methods (lines 14–19 and 22–27). 

如果 compiler 只看 method names, 那麼會很不清楚到底呼叫哪一個 method

Internally, the compiler uses longer method names that include the original method name, the types of each parameter and the exact order of the parameters to determine whether the methods in a class are unique in that class.

在內部, compiler 使用比較長的 method name , 這一個 method name 會包含原本的 method name, types of parameter and the exact order of the parameters, 去決定 method 是不是唯一的

For example, in Fig. 6.10, the compiler might (internally) use the logical name
“square of int” for the square method that specifies an int parameter and “square of
double” for the square method that specifies a double parameter (the actual names the
compiler uses are messier). 

If method1’s declaration begins as

```
void method1(int a, float b)
```

then the compiler might use the logical name “method1 of int and float.” 

If the parameters are specified as

```
void method1(float a, int b)
```

then the compiler might use the logical name “method1 of float and int.” 

The order of the parameter types is important — the compiler considers the preceding two method1
headers to be distinct.

order 是非常重要的, 所以在 compiler 內部如果遇到相同的名字, 他們會使用 method1 of int and float, 跟 method1 of float and int

### Return Types of Overloaded Methods

In discussing the logical names of methods used by the compiler, we did not mention the
return types of the methods. 

Method calls cannot be distinguished only by return type. 

method calls 沒辦法只用 return type 分辨

If you had overloaded methods that differed only by their return types and you called one of the
methods in a standalone statement as in:

```
square(2);
```

the compiler would not be able to determine the version of the method to call, because the
return value is ignored. 

When two methods have the same signature and different return types, the compiler issues an error message indicating that the method is already defined in the class. 

如果只有 return type 不一樣, compiler 會出現 error, 表示 method 已經 defined 在那一個 class 裡面了

Overloaded methods can have different return types if the methods have different
parameter lists. 

overloaded methods 可以有不同的 return types, 如果 methods 有不同的 parameter lists

Also, overloaded methods need not have the same number of parameters.

overloaded methods 並不需要有相同個數的 parameters

#### Common Programming Error 6.8
Declaring overloaded methods with identical parameter lists is a compilation error regardless of whether the return types are different.

如果只有 return type 不一樣, compiler 會出現 compilaton error, 表示 method 已經 defined 在那一個 class 裡面了
