# 7.9 Pass-By-Value vs. Pass-By-Reference

The preceding example demonstrated how arrays and primitive-type array elements are
passed as arguments to methods.
We now take a closer look at how arguments in general are passed to methods.



Two ways to pass arguments in method calls in many programming languages are pass-by-value and pass-by-reference
(sometimes called call-by-value and call-by-reference).

有 2 種方法可以 pass arguments in method calls:
- pass by value
- pass by reference



When an argument is passed by value, a copy of the argument’s value is
passed to the called method. The called method works exclusively with the copy.

如果是 pass by value, 那麼 argument's value 會被複製一份到 called method
然後 called method 處理副本


Changes to the called method’s copy do not affect the original variable’s value in the caller.

處理副本並不會影響原本的文件


When an argument is passed by reference, the called method can access the argument’s value in the caller directly and
modify that data, if necessary.

當 argument is passed by reference, the called method 可以去 access the argument's value 直接調整 data


Pass-by-reference improves performance by eliminating the need to copy possibly large amounts of data.

pass-by-reference 可以改善 performance, 因為他不用再印一份副本


Unlike some other languages, Java does not allow you to choose pass-by-value or pass by-reference — all arguments are
passed by value.

在 java 裡面, 全部都是 pass by value


A method call can pass two types of values to a method — copies of primitive values (e.g., values of type int and double) and copies of references to objects.

一個 method 裡面可以 pass 2 種 types
- primitive values 的副本
- reference 的副本

Objects themselves cannot be passed to methods.

objects 自己沒辦法被傳進 methods

When a method modifies a primitive-type parameter, changes to the parameter have no effect on the original argument value in the calling method.

當 a method 改變傳統 data type 的 value, 並不會影響到原本的 value, 因為傳進去的都是副本

For example, when line 30 in main of Fig. 7.13 passes ```array[3]``` to method ```modifyElement```, the statement in line 45 that doubles the value of parameter element has no effect on the value of ```array[3]``` in main.

This is also true for reference-type parameters. 

If you modify a reference-type parameter so that it refers to another object, only the parameter refers to the new object — the reference stored in the caller’s variable still refers to the original object.


Although an object’s reference is passed by value, a method can still interact with the
referenced object by calling its public methods using the copy of the object’s reference.

method 還是可以跟 referenced object 作互動, 因為可以使用 public methods to use the copy of the object's reference


Since the reference stored in the parameter is a copy of the reference that was passed as an
argument, the parameter in the called method and the argument in the calling method refer to the same object in memory. 

因為 the reference 是傳進來的 argument 的副本, 所以現在 parameter 跟 argument 都是指向相同的 object



For example, in Fig. 7.13, both parameter ```array2``` in method ```modifyArray``` and variable array in main refer to the same array object in memory.

所以 array2 在這裡會指向相同 array object

Any changes made using the parameter ```array2``` are carried out on the object that array
references in the calling method. 

因為現在 array2 = object, 所以現在所做的所有變動都會反映到 object 身上

In Fig. 7.13, the changes made in ```modifyArray``` using ```array2``` affect the contents of the array object referenced by array in main. 


Thus, with a reference to an object, the called method can manipulate the caller’s object directly.
