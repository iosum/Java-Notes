# 7.13 Variable-Length Argument Lists

With variable-length argument lists, you can create methods that receive an unspecified
number of arguments. 

A type followed by an ellipsis (...) in a method’s parameter list
indicates that the method receives a variable number of arguments of that particular type.

可以使用 ```...``` 表示接收無限個的參數


This use of the ellipsis can occur only once in a parameter list, and the ellipsis, together
with its type and the parameter name, must be placed at the end of the parameter list.

只能用在 parameter list, 一定要放在尾端


While you can use method overloading and array passing to accomplish much of what is
accomplished with variable-length argument lists, using an ellipsis in a method’s parameter list is more concise.


Figure 7.20 demonstrates method ```average``` (lines 7–16), which receives a variablelength sequence of doubles. 

```java
// calculate average
public static double average(double... numbers)
{
    double total = 0.0;
    // calculate total using the enhanced for statement
    for (double d : numbers)
        total += d;
    return total / numbers.length;
}
```


Java treats the variable-length argument list as an array whose elements are all of the same type. 

So, the method body can manipulate the parameter numbers as an array of doubles. 

如果使用 ..., java 會把這一坨傳進來的 elements 變成 array
所以上面的例子如果傳進很多的 double, 就會變成 double 的 array

Lines 12–13 use the enhanced for loop to walk through the array and calculate the total of the doubles in the array. 

```java
// calculate total using the enhanced for statement
for (double d : numbers)
    total += d;
```

Line 15 accesses ```numbers.length```
to obtain the size of the numbers array for use in the averaging calculation. 

```java
return total / numbers.length;
```
所以這裡會除以 ```numbers.length```, 因為它是一個 array;


Lines 29, 31 and 33 in main call method average with two, three and four arguments, respectively.

Method average has a variable-length argument list (line 7), so it can average as many double arguments as the caller passes. 

The output shows that each call to method average returns the correct value.
