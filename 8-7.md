# 8.7 Notes on Set and Get Methods

As you know, a class’s private fields can be manipulated only by its methods. 

A typical manipulation might be the adjustment of a customer’s bank balance (e.g., a private in stance variable of a class `BankAccount`) by a method `computeInterest`. 

Set methods are also commonly called **mutator** methods, because they typically change an object’s state — i.e., modify the values of instance variables. 

Get methods are also commonly called **accessor** methods or **query** methods.

### Set and Get Methods vs. public Data

It would seem that providing set and get capabilities is essentially the same as making a
class’s instance variables public. 

-   provide setter and getter 好像就可以直接接觸到 instance variable, 表示能讓 instance variable 變成 public

This is one of the subtleties that makes Java so desirable for software engineering. 

A public instance variable can be read or written by any method that has a reference to an object containing that variable. 

-   一個 public instance variable 只能被 read or written by any method, 這一個 method 有 object 的 reference, 而且 object 裡面包含這一個 public variable

If an instance variable is declared `private`, a public get method certainly allows other methods to access it, but the get method can control how the client can access it. 

-   假設現在 instance variable 是 `private`, 但是有一個 public get method 可以讓其他 methods 去 access 這一個 private instance variable, 但是 get method 可以去控制 how the client can access it. 

For example, a get method might control the format of the data it returns, shielding the client code from the actual data representation.

-   假設現在有一個 get method 可以拿到 the format of the data

A public set method can — and should — carefully scrutinize attempts to modify the variable’s value and throw an exception if necessary. 

-   a public set method 可以去檢查企圖要 modify the variable's value, 然後丟出 exception

For example, attempts to set the day of the month to 37 or a person’s weight to a negative value should be rejected. 

-   假設現在有人企圖要把體重的數字設成負數, 那麼這一個 data 應該要被拒絕掉

Thus, although set and get methods provide access to private data, the access is restricted by the
implementation of the methods. 

-   所以, 雖然 setter and getter 可以去 access private data, 但是 access 會被 methods 的 implementation 所限制

This helps promote good software engineering.

#### Software Engineering Observation 8.6

Classes should never have public nonconstant data, but declaring data `public` `static`
`final` enables you to make constants available to clients of your class. 
For example, class `Math` offers public static final constants `Math.E` and `Math.PI`.

-   classes 不應該要有 public nonconstant data

#### Error-Prevention Tip 8.3

**Do not** provide public static final constants if the constants’ values are likely to change
in future versions of your software.

-   如果 data 有可能改變, 那麼就不要定義 `public` `static` `final`

### Validity Checking in Set Methods

The benefits of data integrity do not follow automatically simply because instance variables are declared `private` — you must provide validity checking. 

A class’s set methods could determine that attempts were made to assign invalid data to objects of the class. 

-   setter 可以決定那些 data 是不是 valid

Typically set methods have `void` return type and use exception handling to indicate attempts
to assign invalid data. We discuss exception handling in detail in Chapter 11.

-   通常來說, setter 會有 void return tpye 和 exeption handling

#### Software Engineering Observation 8.7

When appropriate, provide `public` methods to change and retrieve the values of private
instance variables. 
This architecture helps hide the implementation of a class from its clients, which improves program modifiability.

-   適當的將 method 設為 public 可以讓 program 有調整的空間

#### Error-Prevention Tip 8.4

Using set and get methods helps you create classes that are easier to debug and maintain.
If only one method performs a particular task, such as setting an instance variable in an
object, it’s easier to debug and maintain the class. If the instance variable is not being set
properly, the code that actually modifies instance variable is localized to one set method.
Your debugging efforts can be focused on that one method.

### Predicate Methods

Another common use for accessor methods is to test whether a condition is true or false—
such methods are often called **predicate methods**. 

-   看 condition 是 true 還是 false 的 method 叫做 **predicate methods**

An example would be class ArrayList’s `isEmpty` method, which returns true if the ArrayList is empty and false otherwise. 

A program might test `isEmpty` before attempting to read another item from an ArrayList.
