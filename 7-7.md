# 7.7 Enhanced for Statement

The enhanced for statement iterates through the elements of an array without using a
counter, thus avoiding the possibility of “stepping outside” the array. 

可以避免 loop 出外面


We show how to use the enhanced for statement with the Java API’s prebuilt data structures (called collections) in Section 7.16. 


The syntax of an enhanced for statement is: 

```
for (parameter : arrayName)
statement
```


where parameter has a type and an identifier (e.g., int number), and ```arrayName``` is the array
through which to iterate. 

會有 data type 跟變數名稱, arrayName: 想要遍歷的 array 的名字


The type of the parameter must be consistent with the type of the elements in the array. 

parameter 的 data type 一定要跟 elements 的 data type 一樣

As the next example illustrates, the identifier represents successive element values in the array on successive iterations of the loop.

Figure 7.12 uses the enhanced for statement (lines 12–13) to sum the integers in an array of student grades. 

```java
// add each element's value to total
for (int number : array)
    total += number;
```

The enhanced for’s parameter is of type int, because array contains int values — the loop selects one int value from the array during each iteration. 

enhanced for 是 int 因為 array 的 elements 也是 int

The enhanced for statement iterates through successive values in the array one by one. 

會一個一個 iterates

The statement’s header can be read as “for each iteration, assign the next element of array to
int variable number, then execute the following statement.” 

for loop 可以解釋成當每一次的 iteration, assign 下一個 element, 然後執行 statement


Thus, for each iteration, identifier number represents an int value in array. 

Lines 12–13 are equivalent to the following counter-controlled repetition used in lines 12–13 of Fig. 7.5 to total the integers in array, except that counter cannot be accessed in the enhanced for statement:

```java
for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
total += array[counter];
```

上面的 enhanced for 跟這一個 loop 是一樣的意思

```java
// Fig. 7.12: EnhancedForTest.java
// Using the enhanced for statement to total integers in an array.
public class EnhancedForTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = { 87, 68, 94, 100, 83, 78, 85, 91, 76, 87 };
        int total = 0;
        // add each element's value to total
        for (int number : array)
            total += number;
        System.out.printf("Total of array elements: %d%n", total);
    }
} // end class EnhancedForTest
```

The enhanced for statement can be used only to obtain array elements — it cannot be
used to modify elements. 

enhanced for 只能被用來拿到 array elements, 沒辦法改 elements

If your program needs to modify elements, use the traditional counter-controlled for statement.

如果 elements 需要做變動, 那麼就要用傳統的 for loop

The enhanced for statement can be used in place of the counter-controlled for statement whenever code looping through an array does not require access to the counter indicating the index of the current array element. 

enhanced for 好像有一個 box 是公共物品, 並沒有貼上標籤, 每一個都可以拿裡面的東西使用


For example, totaling the integers in an array requires access only to the element values — the index of each element is irrelevant. 

對於 enhanced elements 來說, 只有 element values 重要, index 並不重要

However, if a program must use a counter for some reason other than simply to loop through
an array (e.g., to print an index number next to each array element value, as in the examples earlier in this chapter), use the counter-controlled for statement.

但是如果要知道 index 就一定要用傳統的 for loop

#### Error-Prevention Tip 7.2
The enhanced for statement simplifies the code for iterating through an array making the
code more readable and eliminating several error possibilities, such as improperly specifying
the control variable’s initial value, the loop-continuation test and the increment expression.

enhanced for 可以避免 error, 也比較 readable


### Java SE 8
The for statement and the enhanced for statement each iterate sequentially from a starting
value to an ending value. 


In Chapter 17, Java SE 8 Lambdas and Streams, you’ll learn about class Stream and its forEach method.

Working together, these provide an elegant, more concise and less error prone means for iterating through collections so that some of the iterations may occur in parallel with others to achieve better multi-core system performance.
