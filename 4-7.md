# Student Class: Nested if…else Statements


### Class Student

Class Student (Fig. 4.4) has features similar to those of class Account (discussed in
Chapter 3). 

Class Student stores a student’s name and average and provides methods for
manipulating these values. 

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private double average;

    public Student(String name, double average){
        this.name = name;
        if(average >= 0.0) {
            this.average = average;
        }
    }

    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName(){
        return name;
    }

    // set the student's average
    public void setAverage(double studentAverage) {
        if(average>=0.0 && average<=100.0){
            this.average = average;
        }
    }

    public double getAverage(){
        return average;
    }

    public String getLetterGrade() {
        String letterGrade = "";
        if(average >= 90.0) {
            letterGrade = "A";
        }
        else if(average < 90.0 && average >= 80.0) {
            letterGrade = "B";
        }
        else if(average < 80.0 && average >= 70.0) {
            letterGrade = "C";
        }
        else if(average < 70.0 && average >= 60.0) {
            letterGrade = "D";
        }
        else letterGrade = "F";

        return letterGrade;

    }
}

```

---

The class contains:
    • instance variable name of type String (line 5) to store a Student’s name

```java
private String name;
```


    • instance variable average of type double (line 6) to store a Student’s average in
    a course

```java
private double average;
```


    • a constructor (lines 9–18) that initializes the name and average

```java
public Student (String name, double average) {
    this.name = name;
    if(average >= 0.0 && average <= 100.0) {
        this.average = average;
    }
}
```


    • methods setName and getName (lines 21–30) to set and get the Student’s name

```java
    public void setName(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName(){
        return name;
    }
```

    • methods setAverage and getAverage (lines 33–46) to set and get the Student’s
    average

```java
    public void setAverage(double studentAverage) {
        if(average>=0.0 && average<=100.0){
            this.average = average;
        }
    }

    public double getAverage(){
        return average;
    }
```

    • method getLetterGrade (lines 49–65), which uses nested if…else statements to
    determine the Student’s letter grade based on the Student’s average

```java
 public String getLetterGrade() {
        String letterGrade = "";
        if(average >= 90.0) {
            letterGrade = "A";
        }
        else if(average < 90.0 && average >= 80.0) {
            letterGrade = "B";
        }
        else if(average < 80.0 && average >= 70.0) {
            letterGrade = "C";
        }
        else if(average < 70.0 && average >= 60.0) {
            letterGrade = "D";
        }
        else letterGrade = "F";

        return letterGrade;

}
```

The constructor and method setAverage each use nested if statements (lines 15–17
and 37–39) to validate the value used to set the average—these statements ensure that the
value is greater than 0.0 and less than or equal to 100.0; otherwise, average’s value is left unchanged. 

Each if statement contains a simple condition. 

每一個 if statement都是simple condition

---

If the condition in line 15 is true,
only then will the condition in line 16 be tested, and only if the conditions in both line 15 and line 16 are true will the statement in line 17 execute.

line 15 == true, 才會執行 line 16, line 16 == true, line 17才會執行

---

### Class StudentTest

To demonstrate the nested if…else statements in class Student’s getLetterGrade
method, class StudentTest’s main method (Fig. 4.5) creates two Student objects (lines 7–
8). 


Next, lines 10–13 display each Student’s name and letter grade by calling the objects’
getName and getLetterGrade methods, respectively.

```java
public class TestStudent {
	public static void main (String [] args){
		Student s1 = new Student("Binfu",34.3);
		Student s2 = new Student("Casey",99.6);
		
		System.out.println(s1.getName() + "\'s grade is " + s1.getLetterGrade());
		System.out.println(s2.getName() + "\'s grade is " + s2.getLetterGrade());
	}
}
```
