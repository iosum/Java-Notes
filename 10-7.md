# 10.7 final Methods and Classes
We saw in Sections 6.3 and 6.10 that variables can be declared `final` to indicate that they
cannot be modified after they’re initialized—such variables represent constant values. 


It’s also possible to declare methods, method parameters and classes with the final modifier.

- method / method 的參數 / classes 都可以是 final

### Final Methods Cannot Be Overridden

A `final` method in a superclass cannot be overridden in a subclass — this guarantees that
the `final` method implementation will be used by all direct and indirect subclasses in the
hierarchy. 

- final 就是字面上的意思, 最後就是最後, 已經不能再 overridden 


Methods that are declared `private` are implicitly `final`, because it’s not possible to override them in a subclass. 

- private 可以看成 implicitly `final`
- 因為沒辦法再 subclasses override private method

Methods that are declared `static` are also implicitly `final`. 

- static 也可以看成 implicitly `final`

A `final` method’s declaration can never change, so all subclasses use the same method implementation, and calls to final methods are resolved at compile time — this is known as static binding.

### Final Classes Cannot Be Superclasses
A `final` class cannot extended to create a subclass. All methods in a `final` class are implicitly `final`. 

- final 裡面的 method 都是 implicitly final

Class `String` is an example of a `final` class. 

If you were allowed to create a
subclass of String, objects of that subclass could be used wherever Strings are expected.


Since class `String` cannot be extended, programs that use `Strings` can rely on the functionality of `String` objects as specified in the Java API. 


Making the class `final` also prevents programmers from creating subclasses that might bypass security restrictions.


We’ve now discussed declaring variables, methods and classes final, and we’ve
emphasized that if something can be `final` it should be `final`. 

Compilers can perform various optimizations when they know something is final. 


When we study concurrency in
Chapter 23, you’ll see that final variables make it much easier to parallelize your programs for use on today’s multi-core processors.
