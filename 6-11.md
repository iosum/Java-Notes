# 6.11 Scope of Declarations

You’ve seen declarations of various Java entities, such as classes, methods, variables and parameters.

Declarations introduce names that can be used to refer to such Java entities. 

The scope of a declaration is the portion of the program that can refer to the declared entity by
its name. 

Such an entity is said to be “in scope” for that portion of the program. 

This section introduces several important scope issues.

The basic scope rules are as follows:

1. The scope of a parameter declaration is the body of the method in which the declaration appears.

    parameter 的 scope 會在 body 出現

2. The scope of a local-variable declaration is from the point at which the declaration appears to the end of that block.

    local variable 的 scope 是在宣告的括弧中生存

3. The scope of a local-variable declaration that appears in the initialization section
of a for statement’s header is the body of the for statement and the other expressions in the header.

    如果把 for 的初始值提到外面, 那麼那一個 variable 的 scope 就會在 body 的括號生存

4. A method or field’s scope is the entire body of the class. This enables a class’s instance methods to use the fields and other methods of the class.

method, field 的 scope 是整個 class

Any block may contain variable declarations. 

If a local variable or parameter in a method has the same name as a field of the class, the field is hidden until the block terminates execution—this is called shadowing. To access a shadowed field in a block:

• If the field is an instance variable, precede its name with the this keyword and a
dot (.), as in this.x.

• If the field is a static class variable, precede its name with the class’s name and
a dot (.), as in ClassName.x.


Figure 6.9 demonstrates scoping issues with fields and local variables. 

Line 7 declares and initializes the field x to 1. 

```java
private static int x = 1;
```

This field is shadowed in any block (or method) that declares a local variable named x. 

Method main (lines 11–23) declares a local variable x (line 13) and initializes it to 5. 

```java
int x = 5; // method's local variable x shadows field x
```

This local variable’s value is output to show that the field x (whose value is 1) is shadowed in main. 

The program declares two other methods — useLocalVariable (lines 26–35) and useField (lines 38–45)—that each take no arguments and return no results. 

Method main calls each method twice (lines 17–20). 

Method ```useLocalVariable``` declares local variable x (line 28). 

```java
int x = 25; // initialized each time useLocalVariable is called
```

When ```useLocalVariable``` is first called (line 17), it creates local variable x and initializes it to 25 (line 28), outputs the value of x (lines 30–31), increments x (line 32) and outputs the value of x again (lines 33–34). 

第一次 call useLoocalVariable 是 create x = 25
output x
increment x
ouput x

When ```uselLocalVariable``` is called a second time (line 19), it recreates local variable x and reinitializes it to 25, so the output of each ```useLocalVariable``` call is identical.

第二次使用 useLoocalVariable, 會重新 create local variable x
並設置為 25

```java
// Fig. 6.9: Scope.java
// Scope class demonstrates field and local variable scopes.
public class Scope
{
    // field that is accessible to all methods of this class
    private static int x = 1;
    // method main creates and initializes local variable x
    // and calls methods useLocalVariable and useField
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // field that is accessible to all methods of this class
        private static int x = 1;
        int x = 5; // method's local variable x shadows field x
        System.out.printf("local x in main is %d%n", x);
        useLocalVariable(); // useLocalVariable has local x
        useField(); // useField uses class Scope's field x
        useLocalVariable(); // useLocalVariable reinitializes local x
        useField(); // class Scope's field x retains its value
        System.out.printf("%nlocal x in main is %d%n", x);
    }

    // create and initialize local variable x during each call
    public static void useLocalVariable()
    {
        int x = 25; // initialized each time useLocalVariable is called
        System.out.printf(
        "%nlocal x on entering method useLocalVariable is %d%n", x);
        ++x; // modifies this method's local variable x
        System.out.printf(
        "local x before exiting method useLocalVariable is %d%n", x);
    }
    // modify class Scope's field x during each call
    public static void useField()
    {
        System.out.printf(
        "%nfield x on entering method useField is %d%n", x);
        x *= 10; // modifies class Scope's field x
        System.out.printf(
        "field x before exiting method useField is %d%n", x);
    }
} // end class Scope
```    

Method ```useField``` does not declare any local variables. 

useField 並沒有任何 local variables

Therefore, when it refers to x, field x (line 7) of the class is used. 

所以用的 x 是 class Scope 底下的 ```private static int x = 1;```

When method ```useField``` is first called (line 18), 

在第一次 call useField的時候 

it outputs the value (1) of field x (lines 40–41), multiplies the field x by 10 (line 42) and outputs he value (10) of field x again (lines 43–44) before returning. 

output: 1
call 完 fields 
output : 10

The next time method ```useField``` is called (line 20), the field has its modified value (10), so the method outputs 10, then 100. 

在第二個的 useFields 的, 因為 value 已經改成 10
所以 output 先是 10 然後 100

Finally, in method main, the program outputs the value of local variable x again
(line 22) to show that none of the method calls modified main’s local variable x, because
the methods all referred to variables named x in other scopes.

### Principle of Least Privilege
In a general sense, “things” should have the capabilities they need to get their job done,
but no more. 

An example is the scope of a variable. 

A variable should not be visible when it’s not needed.

沒有要用 variable 就不要定義
