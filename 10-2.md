# 10.2 Polymorphism Examples

Let’s consider several additional examples of polymorphism.

- polymorphism : perform a single action in different ways
- polymorphism can define 1 interface and have multiple implementations.

Types of polymorphism : 
- method overloading
- method overriding
- Types of Polymorphism – Runtime and compile time

## Quadrilaterals

If class `Rectangle` is derived from class `Quadrilateral`, then a `Rectangle` object is a more
specific version of a `Quadrilateral`. 

-   如果 class `Rectangle` 是從 class `Quadrilateral` 發展而來
-   那麼 `Rectangle` object 會比 `Quadrilateral` 還要具體

Any operation (e.g., calculating the perimeter or the
area) that can be performed on a `Quadrilateral` can also be performed on a `Rectangle`.

-   任何在 `Quadrilateral` 的計算都可以用在 `Rectangle`

These operations can also be performed on other `Quadrilaterals`, such as Squares, Parallelograms and Trapezoids. 

-   這一些 operations 也可以用在其他的四邊形
-   例如 : 正方形...

The polymorphism occurs when a program invokes a method through a superclass `Quadrilateral` variable—at execution time, the correct subclass
version of the method is called, based on the type of the reference stored in the superclass
variable. 

-   多型發生的時候
-   當 a program invoke a method 透過 a superclss `Quadrilateral`
-   當正確的 subclass 被 called
-   會根據當時存在 superclass 的 reference 做判斷
-   

You’ll see a simple code example that illustrates this process in Section 10.3.

### Space Objects in a Video Game

Suppose we design a video game that manipulates objects of classes `Martian`, `Venusian`, `Plutonian`, `SpaceShip` and `LaserBeam`. 

-   假設我們現在 design a video game 
-   有很多 objects of classes

Imagine that each class inherits from the superclass
`SpaceObject`, which contains method `draw`. 

-   假設現在每一個 subclass 繼承 `draw()` 這一個 method

Each subclass implements this method. 

A screen manager maintains a collection (e.g., a `SpaceObject` array) of references to objects of the various classes. 

- 使用一維 array 存 references (data type為 SpaceObject)

To refresh the screen, the screen manager periodically sends each object
the same message — namely, draw. 

-   為了要 refresh the screen
-   manager 會要求大家要 send same messages, 也就是 draw

However, each object responds its own way, based on its class. 

-   但是每一個 object 表現的方法都不一樣

For example, a `Martian` object might draw itself in red with green eyes and the appropriate number of antennae. 

A `SpaceShip` object might draw itself as a bright silver flying saucer. 

A `LaserBeam` object might draw itself as a bright red beam across the screen. 

Again, the
same message (in this case, draw) sent to a variety of objects has “many forms” of results.

-   傳出相同的訊息但是得到不同的結果

A screen manager might use polymorphism to facilitate adding new classes to a system
with minimal modifications to the system’s code. 

Suppose that we want to add `Mercurian`
objects to our video game. 

-   假設現在要多加一個 object

To do so, we’d build a class `Mercurian` that extends `SpaceObject` and provides its own `draw` method implementation. 

-   所以要有一個 subclass inherit superclass
-   然後有自己的 draw method

When `Mercurian` objects appear
in the `SpaceObject` collection, the screen-manager code invokes method `draw`, exactly as it
does for every other object in the collection, regardless of its type. 

So the new `Mercurian` objects
simply “plug right in” without any modification of the screen manager code by the programmer. 

Thus, without modifying the system (other than to build new classes and
modify the code that creates new objects), you can use polymorphism to conveniently
include additional types that were not even considered when the system was created.

### Software Engineering Observation 10.1

Polymorphism enables you to deal in generalities and let the execution-time environment
handle the specifics. You can tell objects to behave in manners appropriate to those objects,
without knowing their specific types, as long as they belong to the same inheritance hierarchy.

### Software Engineering Observation 10.2

Polymorphism promotes extensibility: Software that invokes polymorphic behavior is
independent of the object types to which messages are sent. New object types that can respond
to existing method calls can be incorporated into a system without modifying the base system.
Only client code that instantiates new objects must be modified to accommodate new types.
