# 7.4 Examples Using Arrays

This section presents several examples that demonstrate declaring arrays, creating arrays,
initializing arrays and manipulating array elements.


## 7.4.1 Creating and Initializing an Array
The application of Fig. 7.2 uses keyword new to create an array of 10 int elements, which
are initially zero (the default initial value for int variables). 

Line 9 declares array — a reference capable of referring to an array of int elements — then initializes the variable with a reference to an array object containing 10 int elements. 

```java
int[] array = new int[10]; // create the array object
```

Line 11 outputs the column headings. 

```java
System.out.printf("%s%8s%n", "Index", "Value"); // column headings
```

The first column contains the index (0–9) of each array element, and the second
column contains the default initial value (0) of each array element.

第一行顯示 index 0-9, 第二行顯示各個初始值

```java
public class InitArray
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // declare variable array and initialize it with an array object
        int[] array = new int[10]; // create the array object
        System.out.printf("%s%8s%n", "Index", "Value"); // column headings
        // output each array element's value
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
            System.out.printf("%5d%8d%n", counter, array[counter]);
    }
} // end class InitArray
```

The for statement (lines 14–15) outputs the index (represented by counter) and value
of each array element (represented by array[counter]). 

在這裡 index == counter

Control variable counter is initially 0 — index values start at 0, so using zero-based counting allows the loop to access every element of the array. 

一開始 index 為 0

The for’s loop-continuation condition uses the expression array.length
(line 14) to determine the length of the array. 

array.length 可以決定 array 的長度

In this example, the length of the array is 10,
so the loop continues executing as long as the value of control variable counter is less than 10

在這裡 array 的長度是 10, 所以如果control variable 小於 10, loop 持續進行

The highest index value of a 10 - element array is 9, so using the less-than operator in the
loop-continuation condition guarantees that the loop does not attempt to access an element
beyond the end of the array (i.e., during the final iteration of the loop, counter is 9). 

在最後執行是 index 是 9, 10 的話就會跳出迴圈

We’ll soon see what Java does when it encounters such an out-of-range index at execution time.


## 7.4.2 Using an Array Initializer
You can create an array and initialize its elements with an array initializer — a comma-separated list of expressions (called an initializer list) enclosed in braces. 

可以用 an array initializer 來 initialize 他的 elements

In this case, the array length is determined by the number of elements in the initializer list. 

For example,
```java
int[] n = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
```
creates a five-element array with index values 0–4. 

這一個 array 會 create 5 個 elements, index 從 0 到 4

Element ```n[0]``` is initialized to 10, ```n[1]```
is initialized to 20, and so on. 

When the compiler encounters an array declaration that includes an initializer list, it counts the number of initializers in the list to determine the size
of the array, then sets up the appropriate new operation “behind the scenes.”

當 compiler 遇到這樣的宣告的時候, compiler 自己會去計算有多少個元素並會去給予這一個 array 適當的空間

The application in Fig. 7.3 initializes an integer array with 10 values (line 9) and displays the array in tabular format. 

The code for displaying the array elements (lines 14–15)
is identical to that in Fig. 7.2 (lines 15–16).

```java
// Fig. 7.3: InitArray.java
// Initializing the elements of an array with an array initializer.
public class InitArray
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    // initializer list specifies the initial value for each element
    int[] array = { 32, 27, 64, 18, 95, 14, 90, 70, 60, 37 };
    System.out.printf("%s%8s%n", "Index", "Value"); // column headings
    // output each array element's value
    for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
        System.out.printf("%5d%8d%n", counter, array[counter]);
} // end class InitArray
```

## 7.4.3 Calculating the Values to Store in an Array
The application in Fig. 7.4 creates a 10-element array and assigns to each element one of
the even integers from 2 to 20 (2, 4, 6, …, 20). 

createu 一個 10 elements 的 array, 而且 assign 值給 array

Then the application displays the array in tabular format. 

最後 output 呈現的是表格的模式

The for statement at lines 12–13 calculates an array element’s value by
multiplying the current value of the control variable counter by 2, then adding 2.

最後的值會是從 2, 4, 6, ..., 20 assign 到 index 0-9

```java
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
            array[counter] = 2 + 2 * counter;
```

```java
// Fig. 7.4: InitArray.java
// Calculating the values to be placed into the elements of an array.
public class InitArray
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        final int ARRAY_LENGTH = 10; // declare constant
        int[] array = new int[ARRAY_LENGTH]; // create array

        // calculate value for each array element
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
            array[counter] = 2 + 2 * counter;
            System.out.printf("%s%8s%n", "Index", "Value"); // column headings
        // output each array element's value
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
            System.out.printf("%5d%8d%n", counter, array[counter]);
    }
} // end class InitArray
```
Line 8 uses the modifier ```final``` to declare the constant variable ```ARRAY_LENGTH``` with the
value 10. 

可以看到第 8 行有 final 來定義 ```ARRAY_LENGTH```

Constant variables must be initialized before they’re used and cannot be modified
thereafter. 

constant variables 必定要在被使用前給一個值, 且不能再變更

If you attempt to modify a ```final``` variable after it’s initialized in its declaration,
the compiler issues an error message like

```
cannot assign a value to final variable variableName
```

如果試圖改變有 final modifier 的值, 那麼就會出現上面那一個 error

#### Good Programming Practice 7.2
Constant variables also are called named constants. 

They often make programs more readable than programs that use literal values (e.g., 10)—a named constant such as ARRAY_LENGTH clearly indicates its purpose, whereas a literal value could have different meanings based on its context

定義 constants 可以讓 program more readable


#### Good Programming Practice 7.3
Multiword named constants should have each word separated from the next with an underscore (_) as in ARRAY_LENGTH.

如果 constants 包含 2 個字以上, 就要使用 _


#### Common Programming Error 7.4
Assigning a value to a final variable after it has been initialized is a compilation error.

Similarly, attempting to access the value of a final variable before it’s initialized results in
a compilation error like, “variable variableName might not have been initialized.”


## 7.4.4 Summing the Elements of an Array
Often, the elements of an array represent a series of values to be used in a calculation. 

the elements 代表 values, 這些 values 被用來計算

If, for example, they represent exam grades, a professor may wish to total the elements of the
array and use that sum to calculate the class average for the exam. 

The GradeBook examples in Figs. 7.14 and 7.18 use this technique.

Figure 7.5 sums the values contained in a 10-element integer array. 

下面的 code 是要算總數

The program declares, creates and initializes the array at line 8. 

The for statement performs the calculations. 

for loop 用來運算 sum

Note: 

The values supplied as array initializers are often read into a program rather
than specified in an initializer list. 

比較常使用 array initializers 

For example, an application could input the values from a user or from a file on disk (as discussed in Chapter 15, Files, Streams and Object Serialization). 

Reading the data into a program (rather than “hand coding” it into the program)
makes the program more reusable, because it can be used with different sets of data.

從 files 讀取 data 會比較 reusable, 因為可以被使用 different sets of data

```java
// Fig. 7.5: SumArray.java
// Computing the sum of the elements of an array.
public class SumArray
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = { 87, 68, 94, 100, 83, 78, 85, 91, 76, 87 };
        int total = 0;
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
            total += array[counter];
            System.out.printf("Total of array elements: %d%n", total);
    }
} // end class SumArray
// add each element's value to total
```


## 7.4.5 Using Bar Charts to Display Array Data Graphically

Many programs present data to users in a graphical manner. 

許多 program 所呈現的方式都是用圖像的方式

For example, numeric values are often displayed as bars in a bar chart. 

例如數值型的 values 通常會用來顯示 bar chart

In such a chart, longer bars represent proportionally larger numeric values. 

對於這一種表來說, 愈長的 bars 表示數字愈大

One simple way to display numeric data graphically is with a bar chart that shows each numeric value as a bar of asterisks (*).

一個簡單的方式顯示數值型的 data 是用 bar chart, 而這一個 bar chart 可以顯示有幾個星星

Professors often like to examine the distribution of grades on an exam. 

A professor might graph the number of grades in each of several categories to visualize the grade distribution. 

Suppose the grades on an exam were 87, 68, 94, 100, 83, 78, 85, 91, 76 and 87.

假如現在有一群 grades 要用 bar charts 來顯示

They include one grade of 100, two grades in the 90s, four grades in the 80s, two grades in the 70s, one grade in the 60s and no grades below 60. 

Our next application (Fig. 7.6) stores this grade distribution data in an array of 11 elements, each corresponding to a category of grades. 

For example, ```array[0]``` indicates the number of grades in the range 0–9,
```array[7]``` the number of grades in the range 70–79 and ```array[10]``` the number of 100 grades. 

index 為 0 表示成績從 0 分到 9 分
index 為 1 表示成績從 10 分到 19 分
以此類推

The GradeBook classes later in the chapter (Figs. 7.14 and 7.18) contain code that
calculates these grade frequencies based on a set of grades. 

For now, we manually create the array with the given grade frequencies.


```java
// Fig. 7.6: BarChart.java
// Bar chart printing program.
public class BarChart
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int[] array = { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1 };
        System.out.println("Grade distribution:");
        // for each array element, output a bar of the chart
        for (int counter = 0; counter < array.length; counter++)
        {
        // output bar label ("00-09: ", ..., "90-99: ", "100: ")
        if (counter == 10)
            System.out.printf("%5d: ", 100);
        else
            System.out.printf("%02d-%02d: ",
                counter * 10, counter * 10 + 9);
        for (int stars = 0; stars < array[counter]; stars++)
            System.out.print("*");
        System.out.println();
        }
    }
} // end class BarChart
// print bar of asterisks
```

The application reads the numbers from the array and graphs the information as a bar
chart. 

application 會讀取 numbers 然後 output 出 bar chart

It displays each grade range followed by a bar of asterisks indicating the number of
grades in that range. 

bar chart 會用星星顯示

To label each bar, lines 16–20 output a grade range (e.g., "70-79: ")
based on the current value of counter. 


When counter is 10, line 17 outputs 100 with a field width of 5, followed by a colon and a space, to align the label "100: " with the other bar labels.

當 counter = 10, output 會是 100, 但是 100 是三位數, 所以要另外 format

```java
        if (counter == 10)
            System.out.printf("%5d: ", 100);
```

The nested for statement (lines 23–24) outputs the bars. 

```java
// print bar of asterisks
for (int stars = 0; stars < array[counter]; stars++)
    System.out.print("*");
```


Note the loop-continuation condition at line 23 (```stars < array[counter]```). 

可以看到 condition 是 ```stars < array[counter]```

Each time the program reaches the inner for, the loop counts from 0 up to ```array[counter]```, thus using a value in array to determine the number of asterisks to display. 

因為 array 的 elements 是 stars 的個數, 所以讀取 ```array[counter]``` 就表示要印幾顆星


In this example, no students received a grade below 60, so ```array[0]–array[5]``` contain zeroes, and no asterisks are displayed next to the first six grade ranges. 

在這一個例子, 可以看到沒有學生收到 60 分以下, 所以 ```array[0]–array[5]``` 的 elements 都是 0

In line 19, the format specifier %02d indicates that an int value should be formatted as a field of two digits. 

The 0 flag in the format specifier displays a leading 0 for values with fewer digits than the field width (2).

## 7.4.6 Using the Elements of an Array as Counters

Sometimes, programs use counter variables to summarize data, such as the results of a survey. 

In Fig. 6.7, we used separate counters in our die-rolling program to track the number of occurrences of each side of a six-sided die as the program rolled the die 6,000,000 times.

An array version of this application is shown in Fig. 7.7.

```java
// Fig. 7.7: RollDie.java
// Die-rolling program using arrays instead of switch.
import java.security.SecureRandom;
public class RollDie
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
        int[] frequency = new int[7]; // array of frequency counters
        // roll die 6,000,000 times; use die value as frequency index
        for (int roll = 1; roll <= 6000000; roll++)
            ++frequency[1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6)];
        System.out.printf("%s%10s%n", "Face", "Frequency");
        // output each array element's value
        for (int face = 1; face < frequency.length; face++)
            System.out.printf("%4d%10d%n", face, frequency[face]);
    }
} // end class RollDie
```
Figure 7.7 uses the array frequency (line 10) to count the occurrences of each side of
the die. 

去計算骰子骰到 1 - 6 的次數

The single statement in line 14 of this program replaces lines 22–45 of Fig. 6.7. 

Line 14 uses the random value to determine which frequency element to increment during
each iteration of the loop. 

The calculation in line 14 produces random numbers from 1 to 6, so the array frequency must be large enough to store six counters. 

會產生數字 1 - 6, 所以 array 的長度要從原本的 0 - 5 到 0 - 6, 從 size of 6 到 size of 7

However, we use a seven-element array in which we ignore ```frequency[0]``` — it’s more logical to have the face value 1 increment ``` frequency[1]``` than ```frequency[0]```.

所以這個範例使用的是 7 elements, 但是忽略了 index 0 , 直接從 index 1 的 box 開始

Thus, each face value is used as an index for array frequency. 

所以這樣就可以跟骰子 match 到

In line 14, the calculation inside the square brackets evaluates first to determine which element of the array to increment, then the ++ operator adds one to that element. 

++ 可以表示在哪一個 element 會被 increment, 然後直接加到 element 去

We also replaced lines 49–51 from Fig. 6.7 by looping through array frequency to output the results (lines 19–20). 

When we study Java SE 8’s new functional programming capabilities in Chapter 17, we’ll show how to replace lines 13–14 and 19–20 with a single statement!


### 7.4.7 Using Arrays to Analyze Survey Results

Our next example uses arrays to summarize data collected in a survey. 

這一個範例是使用 array 去 summariz data collected

Consider the following problem statement:

Twenty students were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 the quality of the food in the
student cafeteria, with 1 being “awful” and 5 being “excellent.” 

20個學生要評分cateteria, 分數為 1-5, 

Place the 20 responses in an integer array and determine the frequency of each rating.

把 20 個 responses 放在 array 裡面, 決定 1 - 5 各得多少

This is a typical array-processing application (Fig. 7.8). 

We wish to summarize the number of responses of each type (that is, 1–5). 

我們希望知道 1 - 5 分各得多少

Array responses (lines 9–10) is a 20-element integer array containing the students’ survey responses. 

The last value in the array is intentionally an incorrect response (14). 

最後一個數字在 array 裡面是不正確的

When a Java program executes, array element indices are checked for validity—all indices must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the array. 

每一個 index 會被檢查是否合法, 每一個 index 都必須符合 0 到 the size of array-1

Any attempt to access an element outside that range of indices results in a runtime error that’s known as an ```ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException```. 

每一個 attempt 如果要去 access 外面的 element 會導致 runtime error

At the end of this section, we’ll discuss the invalid response value, demonstrate array bounds checking
and introduce Java’s exception-handling mechanism, which can be used to detect and
handle an ```ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException```.

```java
// Fig. 7.8: StudentPoll.java
// Poll analysis program.
public class StudentPoll
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
    // student response array (more typically, input at runtime)
        int[] responses = { 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 14 };
        int[] frequency = new int[6]; // array of frequency counters
        // for each answer, select responses element and use that value
        // as frequency index to determine element to increment
        for (int answer = 0; answer < responses.length; answer++)
        {
            try
            {
                ++frequency[responses[answer]];
            }
            catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
            {
                System.out.println(e); // invokes toString method
                System.out.printf(" responses[%d] = %d%n%n", answer, responses[answer]);
            }
        }
        System.out.printf("%s%10s%n", "Rating", "Frequency");
        // output each array element's value
        for (int rating = 1; rating < frequency.length; rating++)
            System.out.printf("%6d%10d%n", rating, frequency[rating]);
        }
} // end class StudentPoll

```

### The frequency Array
We use the six-element array frequency (line 11) to count the number of occurrences of
each response. 

在這裡使用 6 個 element array 去計算每一個 response 發生多少次

Each element is used as a counter for one of the possible types of survey responses — ```frequency[1] ``` counts the number of students who rated the food as 1, ```frequency[2]``` counts the number of students who rated the food as 2, and so on.

```frequency[1]``` : 評分為 1 的個數
```frequency[2]``` : 評分為 2 的個數


### Summarizing the Results
The for statement (lines 15–27) reads the responses from the array responses one at a
time and increments one of the counters ```frequency[1]``` to ```frequency[5]```; 

這一段 code 計算出每一個評分的 frequency 是多少

```java
        for (int answer = 0; answer < responses.length; answer++)
        {
            try
            {
                ++frequency[responses[answer]];
            }
            catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e)
            {
                System.out.println(e); // invokes toString method
                System.out.printf(" responses[%d] = %d%n%n", answer, responses[answer]);
            }
        }
```

we ignore ```frequency[0]``` because the survey responses are limited to the range 1–5. 

在這一邊忽略了 ```frequency[0]``` 是因為沒有 0 分這一個選項


The key statement in the loop appears in line 19. 

```
++frequency[responses[answer]];
```

This statement increments the appropriate frequency counter as determined by the value of responses```[answer]```.


Let’s step through the first few iterations of the for statement:

• When the counter answer is 0, ```responses[answer]``` is the value of ```responses[0]``` (that is, 1—see line 9). 

當 counter = 0, ```responses[answer]``` 就表示 ```responses[0]```

In this case, ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` is interpreted as ```frequency[1]```, and the counter ```frequency[1]``` is incremented by one. 

在這一邊, ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` 可以寫成 ```frequency[1]``` , 並從 ```frequency[1]``` 開始往上增加 1

To evaluate the expression, we begin with the value in the innermost set of brackets (answer, currently 0). 

為了要計算 expression, 我們會從最內層的括弧開始

The value of answer is plugged into the expression, and the next set of brackets (```responses[answer]```) is evaluated. 


That value is used as the index for the frequency array to determine which counter to increment (in th
case, ```frequency[1]```).

value 被用來代表 index for frequency 這一個 array, 去決定哪一個 counter 增加


• The next time through the loop ```answer``` is 1, ```responses[answer]``` is the value of
```responses[1]``` (that is, 2 — see line 9), so ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` is interpreted as ```frequency[2]```, causing ```frequency[2]``` to be incremented.

在下一次 answer = 1, 那麼 ```responses[answer]``` 的值就會變成 ```response[1]```, 那這一個 response[1] 可以對應到第 9 行的 response 矩陣, 所以 ```response[1]``` = 2, 所以 ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` = ```frequency[2]```, 所以 ```frequency[2]``` 會 ++



• When ```answer``` is 2, ```responses[answer]``` is the value of ```responses[2]``` (that is, 5—
see line 9), so ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` is interpreted as ```frequency[5]```
causing ```frequency[5]``` to be incremented, and so on.

當 answer = 2, ```responses[answer]``` = ```responses[2]```, 那麼在看回第 9 行的 response 矩陣, 可以看到```responses[2]``` =  5, 所以 ```frequency[responses[answer]]``` = ```frequency[5]```, 所以導致 ```frequency[5]``` ++


Regardless of the number of responses processed, only a six-element array (in which we ignore element zero) is required to summarize the results, because all the correct response values are values from 1 to 5, and the index values for a six-element array are 0–5. 

只有 input 是 1-5 可以被放進這一個 frequency array 裡面


In the program’s output, the ```Frequency``` column summarizes only 19 of the 20 values in the responses array — the last element of the array responses contains an (intentionally) incor
rect response that was not counted. 

在 output 中, 可以看到 frequency 那一行如果把總數相加起來的話, 只會等於 19, 那是因為最後一個數字是不合法的

Section 7.5 discusses what happens when the program in Fig. 7.8 encounters the invalid response (14) in the last element of array responses.
