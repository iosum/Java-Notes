# For Repetition Statement

Section 5.2 presented the essentials of counter-controlled repetition. 

The while statement can be used to implement any counter-controlled loop. 


Java also provides the for repetition statement, which specifies the counter-controlled-repetition details in a single line of code. 

Figure 5.2 reimplements the application of Fig. 5.1 using for.

介紹 for loop

---

```java
// Counter-controlled repetition with the for repetition statement.
public class ForCounter {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        // for statement header includes initialization,
        // loop-continuation condition and increment
        for(int counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter ++) {
            System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

When the for statement (lines 10–11) begins executing, the control variable counter
is declared and initialized to 1. 

```java
for (int counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter++)
    System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
```

counter 被宣告，被設值為 1

---

(Recall from Section 5.2 that the first two elements of counter-controlled repetition are the control variable and its initial value.) 

Next, the program checks the loop-continuation condition, counter <= 10, which is between the two
required semicolons. 

檢查 loop condition, 在這裡是 counter <=10

--- 

Because the initial value of counter is 1, the condition initially is true. 

因為一開始 counter = 1, condition 是 true

---

Therefore, the body statement (line 11) displays control variable counter’s value, namely 1. 

因此在
```java
System.out.printf("%d ", counter);
```
這一行中會先印出1

---

After executing the loop’s body, the program increments counter in the expression counter++, which appears to the right of the second semicolon. 

在執行完 loop 的 body, counter++,

---

Then the loop-continuation test is performed again to determine whether the program should continue with the next iteration of the loop. 

然後再檢查 condition 是不是要繼續下去

---

At this point, the control variable’s value is 2, so the condition is still true (the final value is not exceeded)—thus, the program performs the body
statement again (i.e., the next iteration of the loop). 

在這邊，counter = 2, 所以 condition 還是 true, 所以 program 繼續執行 loop 的 body

---

This process continues until the numbers 1 through 10 have been displayed and the counter’s value becomes 11, causing the loop-continuation test to fail and repetition to terminate (after 10 repetitions of the loop body). 


這個 prgress 會一直執行直到 number 1-10 被印出來且counter變成 11, counter變成11會導致 condition = false, 整個迴圈終止離開

---

Then the program performs the first statement after the for — in this case, line 13.

離開後執行這一行程式 
```java
System.out.println();
```
---

Figure 5.2 uses (in line 10) the loop-continuation condition counter <= 10. 

If you incorrectly specified counter < 10 as the condition, the loop would iterate only nine times.


This is a common logic error called an off-by-one error.


如果把 counter 設成 < 10, 則只會印1-9, 這種 error 叫做off-by-one error

### A Closer Look at the for Statement’s Header

Figure 5.3 takes a closer look at the for statement in Fig. 5.2.

![for-statement-header-components](/img/for_annotation.png)

The first line — including the keyword for and everything in parentheses after for (line 10 in Fig. 5.2) — is sometimes called the for statement header. 

The for header “does it all” — it specifies each item needed for counter - controlled repetition with a control variable. 

If there’s more than one statement in the body of the for, braces are required to define the body of the loop.

### General Format of a for Statement

```
for (initialization; loopContinuationCondition; increment)
    statement
```

The general format of the for statement is
where the initialization expression names the loop’s control variable and optionally provides
its initial value, ```loopContinuationCondition``` determines whether the loop should continue executing and increment modifies the control variable’s value, so that the loop-continuation
condition eventually becomes false. 

中間的要變 false才會跳出迴圈

---

The two semicolons in the for header are required. 

If the loop-continuation condition is initially false, the program does not execute the for
statement’s body. 

Instead, execution proceeds with the statement following the for.

如果一開始判斷 condition 是 false, execution就會跳過for loop 直接執行下面 program

---

### Representing a for Statement with an Equivalent while Statement

The for statement often can be represented with an equivalent while statement as follows:

```
initialization;
while (loopContinuationCondition) {
    statement
    increment;
}
```

In Section 5.8, we show a case in which a for statement cannot be represented with an
equivalent while statement. 

Typically, for statements are used for counter-controlled repetition and while statements for sentinel-controlled repetition. 

However, while and for
can each be used for either repetition type.

for 跟 while 可以互換，for通常用在知道終止條件，while則是用在 setinel-controlled repetition

---

### Scope of a for Statement’s Control Variable

If the initialization expression in the for header declares the control variable (i.e., the control variable’s type is specified before the variable name, as in Fig. 5.2), the control variable
can be used only in that for statement — it will not exist outside it. 

如果把 初始條件放在 迴圈裏面，那麼只能用在迴圈裡面，外面就無法使用

---

This restricted use is known as the variable’s __scope__. 

這叫做 scope

---


The scope of a variable defines where it can be used in a program. 

scope定義變數可以在哪裡使用

---

For example, a local variable can be used only in the method that declares it and only from the point of declaration through the end of the method. 

如果是 local variable 就只能用在當初宣告的 { } 裡面

---

### Expressions in a for Statement’s Header Are Optional

All three expressions in a for header are optional.

在for裏面的變數都是optional

---

If the ```loopContinuationCondition``` is omitted, Java assumes that the loop-continuation condition is always true, thus creating an infinite loop. 

如果判斷式是省略的，java 會一直認為是 true, 因此會有無限loop

---

You might omit the initialization expression if the program initializes the control variable before the loop. 

如果 program 自己有定義 initialization, 那就不用再寫初始值

---

You might omit the increment expression if the program calculates the increment with statements in the loop’s body or if no increment is needed.

如果沒有 increment expression, 那麼就會在body裡面做increment expression, 或者根本也不需要

---

The increment expression in a for acts as if it were a standalone statement at the end of
the for’s body. 

Therefore, the expressions are equivalent increment expressions in a for statement. 

```
counter = counter + 1
counter += 1
++counter
counter++

```


Many programmers prefer counter++ because it’s concise and because a for loop evaluates its increment expression after its body executes, so the postfix increment form seems more natural. 

In this case, the variable being incremented does not appear in a larger expression, so preincrementing and postincrementing actually have the same effect.

前 ++跟後++的 effect 一樣

---


### Placing Arithmetic Expressions in a for Statement’s Header

The initialization, loop-continuation condition and increment portions of a for statement can contain arithmetic expressions. 

For example, assume that x = 2 and y = 10. If x and y are not modified in the body of the loop, the statement


```java
for (int j = x; j <= 4 * x * y; j += y / x)
```
is equivalent to the statement


```java
for (int j = 2; j <= 80; j += 5)
```

The increment of a for statement may also be negative, in which case it’s a decrement, and
the loop counts downward.

可以由大到小，也可以由小到大，遞減

### UML Activity Diagram for the for Statement

The for statement’s UML activity diagram is similar to that of the while statement
(Fig. 4.6). 


Figure 5.4 shows the activity diagram of the for statement in Fig. 5.2. 


The diagram makes it clear that initialization occurs once before the loop-continuation test is
evaluated the first time, and that incrementing occurs each time through the loop after the
body statement executes.
