# 10.6 Allowed Assignments Between Superclass and Subclass Variables

Now that you’ve seen a complete application that processes diverse subclass objects polymorphically, we summarize what you can and cannot do with superclass and subclass objects
and variables. 


Although a subclass object also is a superclass object, the two classes are nevertheless different. 


As discussed previously, subclass objects can be treated as objects of their superclass. 

- subclasses objects 可以看成 superclass

But because the subclass can have additional subclass-only members, assigning
a superclass reference to a subclass variable is not allowed without an explicit cast—such an
assignment would leave the subclass members undefined for the superclass object.

- 但是因為 subclass 有自己專屬的屬性, 所以沒辦法把 superclass 看成 subclasses

We’ve discussed three proper ways to assign superclass and subclass references to variables of superclass and subclass types:
1. Assigning a superclass reference to a superclass variable is straightforward.
2. Assigning a subclass reference to a subclass variable is straightforward.
3. Assigning a subclass reference to a superclass variable is safe, because the subclass
object is an object of its superclass. 


However, the superclass variable can be used
to refer only to superclass members. 


If this code refers to subclass-only members
through the superclass variable, the compiler reports errors.
