# 14.2 Fundamentals of Characters and Strings
Characters are the fundamental building blocks of Java source programs. 

Every program is composed of a sequence of characters that—when grouped together meaningfully—are interpreted by the Java compiler as a series of instructions used to accomplish a task. 

A program may contain character literals. 


A character literal is an integer value represented as a character in single quotes. 


For example, 'z' represents the integer value of z, and '\\t' represents the integer value of a tab character. 


The value of a character literal is the integer value of the character in the Unicode character set.

- character literal 的 value 是 unicode

Appendix B presents the integer equivalents of the characters in the ASCII character set, which is a subset of Unicode (discussed
in online Appendix H).

Recall from Section 2.2 that a string is a sequence of characters treated as a single unit.

A string may include letters, digits and various special characters, such as +, -, \*, / and $.


A string is an object of class `String`. 

- 一個 string object 是 class String 

`String` literals (stored in memory as `String` objects) are written as a sequence of characters in double quotation marks, as in:

- String literals 被存在 memory 裡面是 `String` objects


```java
"John Q. Doe" (a name)
"9999 Main Street" (a street address)
"Waltham, Massachusetts" (a city and state)
"(201) 555-1212" (a telephone number)
```



A string may be assigned to a String reference. 

```java
String color = "blue";
```


The declaration initializes `String` variable color to refer to a String object that contains the string "blue"

- 上面的式子是初始化 `String` variable color, 然後這一個 color 指到一個 String class的 object , 這一個 object 裡面有一個 string "blue"

### Performance Tip 14.1
To conserve memory, Java treats all string literals with the same contents as a single String object that has many references to it.
