# 10.4 Abstract Classes and Methods

When we think of a class, we assume that programs will create objects of that type. 

Sometimes it’s useful to declare classes — called `abstract` classes — for which you never intend to
create objects. 

Because they’re used only as superclasses in inheritance hierarchies, we refer
to them as abstract superclasses. 

-   abstract 只是用來方便在 superclasses 的繼承關係

These classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, because, as we’ll soon see, **abstract classes are incomplete**. 

-   abstract classes 不能用來 instantiate objects

Subclasses **must** declare the “missing pieces” to become “concrete” classes, from which you can instantiate objects.

-   subclasses 一定要宣告 abstract classes

Otherwise, these subclasses, too, will be abstract. 

We demonstrate abstract classes in Section 10.5.

## Purpose of Abstract Classes

An abstract class’s purpose is to provide an appropriate superclass from which other classes
can inherit and thus share a common design. 

-   abstract class 是為了要提供 subclasses 可以繼承的 class

In the `Shape` hierarchy of Fig. 9.3, for example, subclasses inherit the notion of what it means to be a Shape—perhaps common attributes such as `location`, `color` and `borderThickness`, and behaviors such as `draw`, `move`,
`resize` and `changeColor`. 

Classes that can be used to instantiate objects are called concrete classes. 

-   可以用來 instantiate objects 叫做 concrete classes

Such classes provide implementations of every method they declare (some of the
implementations can be inherited). 

For example, we could derive concrete classes `Circle`,
`Square` and `Triangle` from abstract superclass `TwoDimensionalShape`. 

Similarly, we could
derive concrete classes `Sphere`, `Cube` and `Tetrahedron` from `abstract` superclass `ThreeDimensionalShape`. 

Abstract superclasses are too general to create real objects—they specify
only what is common among subclasses. 

-   abstract superclasses 通常會太籠統, 導致沒辦法 create object

We need to be more specific before we can create
objects. 

For example, if you send the draw message to abstract class `TwoDimensionalShape`,
the class knows that two-dimensional shapes should be drawable, but it does not know
what specific shape to draw, so it cannot implement a real draw method. 

-   只知道要做那一個 method, 不過不知道怎麼做

Concrete classes provide the specifics that make it reasonable to instantiate objects.

Not all hierarchies contain `abstract` classes. 

-   並不是所有的都會包含 abstract classes

However, you’ll often write client code
that uses only abstract superclass types to reduce the client code’s dependencies on a range
of subclass types. 

-   但是有些時候寫 abstract superclasses to reduce the dependencies

For example, you can write a method with a parameter of an abstract
superclass type. 

When called, such a method can receive an object of any concrete class that
directly or indirectly extends the superclass specified as the parameter’s type.

Abstract classes sometimes constitute several levels of a hierarchy. 

-   abstract classes 有時候會有很多層

For example, the
`Shape` hierarchy of Fig. 9.3 begins with abstract class `Shape`.

On the next level of the hierarchy are abstract classes `TwoDimensionalShape` and `ThreeDimensionalShape`. 

-   Shape : abstract
-   TwoDimensionalShape : Abstract
-   ThreeDimensionalShape : Abstract

The next
level of the hierarchy declares concrete classes for `TwoDimensionalShapes` (Circle, Square
and Triangle) and for `ThreeDimensionalShapes` (Sphere, Cube and Tetrahedron).

Declaring an Abstract Class and Abstract Methods
You make a class abstract by declaring it with keyword `abstract`. 

An abstract class normally contains one or more abstract methods. 

-   一個 abstract class 會包含一個或多的 abstract methods

An abstract method is an instance method
with keyword `abstract` in its declaration, as in

```java
public abstract void draw(); // abstract method
```

Abstract methods do not provide implementations. 

A class that contains any abstract
methods **must be explicitly declared abstract even if that class contains some concrete
(nonabstract) methods.**

-   如果是 abstract 一定要 declare abstract
-   即便 class 裡面有 non-abstract methods

Each concrete subclass of an abstract superclass also must provide
concrete implementations of each of the superclass’s abstract methods. 

**`Constructors` and
`static` methods cannot be declared abstract.**

**Constructors are not inherited**, so an
abstract constructor could never be implemented. 

Though non-private **static
methods are inherited, they cannot be overridden**. 

Since **abstract methods are meant to
be overridden** so that they can process objects based on their types, it would not make
sense to declare a static method as abstract.

### Software Engineering Observation 10.4

An abstract class declares common attributes and behaviors (both abstract and concrete)
of the various classes in a class hierarchy. 

An abstract class typically contains one or more
abstract methods that subclasses must override if they are to be concrete. 

The instance
variables and concrete methods of an abstract class are subject to the normal rules of
inheritance.


### Common Programming Error 10.1
Attempting to instantiate an object of an abstract class is a compilation error.

### Common Programming Error 10.2
Failure to implement a superclass’s abstract methods in a subclass is a compilation error
unless the subclass is also declared abstract.


### Using Abstract Classes to Declare Variables
Although we cannot instantiate objects of abstract superclasses, you’ll soon see that we can
use abstract superclasses to **declare variables that can hold references to objects of any concrete class derived from those abstract superclasses**. 

- declare variables 
- that can hold references to objects of any concrete class 
- derived from those abstract superclasses 


We’ll use such variables to manipulate
subclass objects polymorphically. 


You also can use abstract superclass names to invoke
static methods declared in those abstract superclasses.

- use abstract superclass names
- to invoke `static` methods


Consider another application of polymorphism. 

A drawing program needs to display
many shapes, including types of new shapes that you’ll add to the system after writing the
drawing program. 


The drawing program might need to display shapes, such as `Circles`,
`Triangles`, `Rectangles` or others, that derive from abstract class `Shape`. 


The drawing program uses `Shape` variables to manage the objects that are displayed. 


To draw any object in
this inheritance hierarchy, the drawing program uses a superclass Shape variable containing a reference to the subclass object to invoke the object’s draw method. 


This method
is declared abstract in superclass `Shape`, so each concrete subclass must implement
method draw in a manner specific to that shape—each object in the Shape inheritance
hierarchy knows how to draw itself. 


The drawing program does not have to worry about the
type of each object or whether the program has ever encountered objects of that type.

### Layered Software Systems
Polymorphism is particularly effective for implementing so-called **layered software systems**.


In operating systems, for example, each type of physical device could operate quite differently from the others. 


Even so, commands to read or write data from and to devices may
have a certain uniformity. 


For each device, the operating system uses a piece of software
called a device driver to control all communication between the system and the device. 


The
write message sent to a device-driver object needs to be interpreted specifically in the context of that driver and how it manipulates devices of a specific type. 


However, the write
call itself really is no different from the write to any other device in the system—place some
number of bytes from memory onto that device. 


An object-oriented operating system
might use an abstract superclass to provide an “interface” appropriate for all device drivers.



Then, through inheritance from that abstract superclass, **subclasses are formed that all behave similarly**. 


The device-driver methods are declared as abstract methods in the abstract
superclass. 


The **implementations** of these abstract methods are provided in the **concrete subclasses** that correspond to the specific types of device drivers.
 
 
New devices are always
being developed, often long after the operating system has been released.


When you buy a new device, it comes with a device driver provided by the device vendor. 

The device is immediately operational after you connect it to your computer and install the driver. 


This is another elegant example of how polymorphism makes systems extensible.
