# 8.14 Package Access
If no access modifier (public, protected or private—we discuss protected in
Chapter 9) is specified for a method or variable when it’s declared in a class, the method
or variable is considered to have **package access**. 

- no access modifier
- then have package access

In a program that consists of one class
declaration, this has no specific effect. 


However, if a program uses multiple classes from the
same package (i.e., a group of related classes), these classes can access each other’s packageaccess members directly through references to objects of the appropriate classes, or in the
case of `static` members through the class name. 

- a program uses many classes from the same package
- classes can access each other's package access members
- access members through references to objects 


Package access is rarely used.

- rarely used



Figure 8.15 demonstrates package access. 

The app contains two classes in one sourcecode file—the `PackageDataTest` class containing main (lines 5–21) and the `PackageData`
class (lines 24–41). 



Classes in the same source file are part of the same package. 

- same classes, same source file
- same package

Consequently, class `PackageDataTest` is allowed to modify the package-access data of `PackageData` objects. 

- Test can modify the package access data

When you compile this program, the compiler produces two separate .class
files—PackageDataTest.class and PackageData.class. The compiler places the two
.class files in the same directory. 

- the compiler produces 2 classes
  - PackagesDataTest.class
  - PackageData.class


You can also place class `PackageData` (lines 24–41) in
a separate source-code file.


In the `PackageData` class declaration, lines 26–27 declare the instance variables
number and string with no access modifiers—therefore, these are package-access instance
variables. 

```java
int number; // package-access instance variable
String string; // package-access instance variable
```


Class `PackageDataTest’s` main method creates an instance of the `PackageData`
class (line 9) to demonstrate the ability to modify the `PackageData` instance variables
directly (as shown in lines 15–16). 

```java
PackageData packageData = new PackageData();
```
```java
// change package access data in packageData object
packageData.number = 77;
packageData.string = "Goodbye";
```


The results of the modification can be seen in the
output window.


```java
// Fig. 8.15: PackageDataTest.java
// Package-access members of a class are accessible by other classes
// in the same package.
public class PackageDataTest
{
    public static void main(String\[] args)
    {
        PackageData packageData = new PackageData();
        // output String representation of packageData
        System.out.printf("After instantiation:%n%s%n", packageData);
        // change package access data in packageData object
        packageData.number = 77;
        packageData.string = "Goodbye";
        // output String representation of packageData
        System.out.printf("%nAfter changing values:%n%s%n", packageData);
        
    } // end class PackageDataTest
        // class with package access instance variables
        class PackageData
        {
            int number; // package-access instance variable
            String string; // package-access instance variable
            // constructor
            public PackageData()
            {
                number = 0;
                string = "Hello";
            }
            // return PackageData object String representation
            public String toString()
            {
                return String.format("number: %d; string: %s", number, string);
            }
    }
} // end class PackageData
```
