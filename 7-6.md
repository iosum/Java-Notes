# 7.6 Case Study: Card Shuffling and Dealing Simulation

The examples in the chapter thus far have used arrays containing elements of primitive types. 

Recall from Section 7.2 that the elements of an array can be either primitive types or reference types. 

This section uses random-number generation and an array of referencetype elements, namely objects representing playing cards, to develop a class that simulates
card shuffling and dealing. 


這一個例子會使用 objects 代表 playing cards, 去發展一個 class 來模擬卡片的 shuffle and dealing

This class can then be used to implement applications that play specific card games. 

The exercises at the end of the chapter use the classes developed here to build a simple poker application.

We first develop class Card (Fig. 7.9), which represents a playing card that has a face
(e.g., "Ace", "Deuce", "Three", …, "Jack", "Queen", "King") and a suit (e.g., "Hearts",
"Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades"). 

我們一開始先發展 class Card, 這一個 Card 有 face(1-13) 還有 suit(hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades)

Next, we develop the ```DeckOfCards``` class (Fig. 7.10), which creates a deck of 52 playing cards in which each element is a Card object. 

DeckOfCards: 52 張牌

We then build a test application (Fig. 7.11) that demonstrates class DeckOfCards’s card shuffling
and dealing capabilities.



### Class Card

Class Card (Fig. 7.9) contains two String instance variables — face and suit — that are
used to store references to the face name and suit name for a specific Card. 

Card 會有 2 個 string objects , face and suit, 這個會儲存 references

The constructor for the class (lines 10–14) receives two Strings that it uses to initialize face and suit.


Method ```toString``` (lines 17–20) creates a String consisting of the face of the card, the
String " of " and the suit of the card. 

Card’s ```toString``` method can be invoked explicitly to obtain a string representation of a Card object (e.g., "Ace of Spades"). 

在 Card 裡面的 toString 印出東西

The ```toString``` method of an object is called implicitly when the object is used where a String is expected (e.g., when printf outputs the object as a String using the %s format specifier or when
the object is concatenated to a String using the + operator). 

toString 被 call 的時候是有 String 存在的

For this behavior to occur, ```toString``` must be declared with the header shown in Fig. 7.9.

```java
// Fig. 7.9: Card.java
// Card class represents a playing card.
public class Card
{
    private final String face; // face of card ("Ace", "Deuce", ...)
    private final String suit; // suit of card ("Hearts", "Diamonds", ...)
    // two-argument constructor initializes card's face and suit
    public Card(String cardFace, String cardSuit)
    {
        this.face = cardFace; // initialize face of card
        this.suit = cardSuit; // initialize suit of card
    }
    // return String representation of Card
    public String toString()
    {
        return face + " of " + suit;
    }
} // end class Card

```


### Class DeckOfCards
Class ```DeckOfCards``` (Fig. 7.10) declares as an instance variable a Card array named ```deck```
(line 7). 

```DeckOfCards```: 宣告 ```deck``` array

An array of a reference type is declared like any other array. 

Class ```DeckOfCards``` also declares an integer instance variable ```currentCard``` (line 8) representing the sequence number (0–51) of the next Card to be dealt from the deck array, and a named constant ```NUMBER_OF_CARDS``` (line 9) indicating the number of Cards in the deck (52).

```currentCard```: int, index of next card to be dealt 
```NUMBER_OF_CARDS``` : deck 裡面有多少張卡

```java
// Fig. 7.10: DeckOfCards.java
// DeckOfCards class represents a deck of playing cards.
import java.security.SecureRandom;
public class DeckOfCards
{
    private Card[] deck; // array of Card objects
    private int currentCard; // index of next Card to be dealt (0-51)
    private static final int NUMBER_OF_CARDS = 52; // constant # of Cards
    // random number generator
    private static final SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
    // constructor fills deck of Cards
    public DeckOfCards()
    {
        String[] faces = { "Ace", "Deuce", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King" };
        String[] suits = { "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Spades" };
        deck = new Card[NUMBER_OF_CARDS]; // create array of Card objects 
        currentCard = 0; // first Card dealt will be deck[0]
        // populate deck with Card objects
        for (int count = 0; count < deck.length; count++)
            deck[count] = new Card(faces[count % 13], suits[count / 13]);
    }
    // shuffle deck of Cards with one-pass algorithm
    public void shuffle()
    {
        // next call to method dealCard should start at deck[0] again
        currentCard = 0;
    // for each Card, pick another random Card (0-51) and swap them
        for (int first = 0; first < deck.length; first++)
        {
        // select a random number between 0 and 51
            int second = randomNumbers.nextInt(NUMBER_OF_CARDS);
            // swap current Card with randomly selected Card
            Card temp = deck[first];
            deck[first] = deck[second];
            deck[second] = temp;
        }
    }
    // deal one Card
    public Card dealCard()
    {
        // determine whether Cards remain to be dealt
        if ( currentCard < deck.length)
        return deck[currentCard++]; // return current Card in array
        else
        return null; // return null to indicate that all Cards were dealt
    }
} // end class DeckOfCards
```

### DeckOfCards Constructor
The class’s constructor instantiates the deck array (line 20) with ```NUMBER_OF_CARDS``` (52) elements. 

建構子裡面 new 一個 Card 的 object 的 array 


The elements of deck are null by default, so the constructor uses a for statement
(lines 24–26) to fill the deck with Cards. 

elements of deck 都是 null, by default, 所以下面這一段 code 

```java
// populate deck with Card objects
for (int count = 0; count < deck.length; count++)
    deck[count] = new Card(faces[count % 13], suits[count / 13]);
```

是用來填滿 deck 這一個 array 的, 如果是在現實生活就是透過 for loop, 我們可以拿到一副完整的撲克牌, 如果沒有這一個 for loop, 那麼這會拿到外面裝牌的盒子而已, 裡面會是空的



The loop initializes control variable count to 0 and
loops while count is less than ```deck.length```, causing count to take on each integer value from
0 to 51 (the indices of the deck array). 


這一個 loop 會從 0 走到 51


Each Card is instantiated and initialized with two
Strings—one from the faces array (which contains the Strings "Ace" through "King")
and one from the suits array (which contains the Strings "Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs"
and "Spades"). 


每一個 Card 會有 2 個 String, 一個是 faces array(從 1- 13), 另外一個是 suits array("Hearts", "Diamonds", "Clubs" and "Spades")


The calculation ```count % 13``` always results in a value from 0 to 12 (the 13 indices of the faces array in lines 16–17), and the calculation ```count / 13``` always results in a
value from 0 to 3 (the four indices of the suits array in line 18). 


count % 13 的結果永遠都是 0 - 12, 13 的數字是因為 faces array 有 13 個 elements, count / 13 的結果是 0 - 3, 是因為有 4 個 elements in suits array.



When the deck array is initialized, it contains the Cards with faces "Ace" through "King" in order for each suit (all
13 "Hearts", then all the "Diamonds", then the "Clubs", then the "Spades"). 

當 deck array 被 new 的時候, 就是一副新牌好的牌, 1-13 從 hearts 開始, diamonds, clubs, spades, 因為 suits array 是這樣放的


We use arrays
of Strings to represent the faces and suits in this example. 


In Exercise 7.34, we ask you to
modify this example to use arrays of enum constants to represent the faces and suits.


### DeckOfCards Method shuffle
Method ```shuffle``` (lines 30–46) shuffles the Cards in the deck. 

shuffle(): 洗牌

The method loops through all 52 Cards (array indices 0 to 51). 

for loop 會從 0 - 51 跑


For each Card, a number between 0 and 51 is picked
randomly to select another Card. 

對於每一個 Card, 數字 0-51 中會被隨機選到


Next, the current Card object and the randomly selected Card object are swapped in the array. 

然後, 現在的 Card object 和隨機所選的 Card object 會互相交換


This exchange is performed by the three assignments
in lines 42–44. 


The extra variable temp temporarily stores one of the two Card objects being swapped. 

The swap cannot be performed with only the two statements 

```
deck[first] = deck[second];
deck[second] = deck[first];
```

If ```deck[first]``` is the "Ace" of "Spades" and ```deck[second]``` is the "Queen" of "Hearts",
after the first assignment, both array elements contain the "Queen" of "Hearts" and the
"Ace" of "Spades" is lost—so, the extra variable temp is needed. 

為甚麼需要 temp? 因為如果只有 2 個, 假如 first 是方塊1, second 是愛心 12, 那麼當 second assign 值給 first 的時候, 這一個時候的 first 值就會不見了, 那麼當執行到下一行, first 要 assign 給 second 的時候, first 的值就還是second


After the for loop terminates, the Card objects are randomly ordered. 

當 for loop 終止, Card 就會是隨機的卡(已經發完好的牌)

A total of only 52 swaps are made in a single
pass of the entire array, and the array of Card objects is shuffled!



[Note: It’s recommended that you use a so-called unbiased shuffling algorithm for real
card games. Such an algorithm ensures that all possible shuffled card sequences are equally
likely to occur. Exercise 7.35 asks you to research the popular unbiased Fisher-Yates shuffling algorithm and use it to reimplement the DeckOfCards method shuffle.]


### DeckOfCards Method dealCard
Method ```dealCard``` (lines 49–56) deals one Card in the array. 

dealCard(): 每一次處理一張牌

Recall that ```currentCard``` indicates the index of the next Card to be dealt (i.e., the Card at the top of the deck). 

currentCard: 是存下一張要被處理的牌


Thus, line 52 compares ```currentCard``` to the length of the ```deck``` array. 




If the ```deck``` is not empty (i.e., ```currentCard``` is less than 52), line 53 returns the “top” Card and postincrements ```currentCard``` to prepare for the next call to dealCard — otherwise, null is returned. 

假如現在 deck 有值, 也就是說 currentCard 是小於 52, 就會繼續處理下一張值, 要不然就沒有牌, return null


Recall from Chapter 3 that null represents a “reference to nothing.”

要記住 null 表示 ***reference to nothing***

### Shuffling and Dealing Cards

Figure 7.11 demonstrates class ```DeckOfCards```. Line 9 creates a ```DeckOfCards``` object named
```myDeckOfCards```. 

```java
DeckOfCards myDeckOfCards = new DeckOfCards();
```
new 一個 DeckOfCards Object, 叫做 myDeckOfCards


The ```DeckOfCards``` constructor creates the deck with the 52 Card objects in order by suit and face.

因為 ```DeckOfCards``` constructor 會製造出一副全新的牌


Line 10 invokes ```myDeckOfCards```’s shuffle method to rearrange the Card objects. 

```
myDeckOfCards.shuffle(); 
```

shuffle(): 洗牌


Lines 13–20 deal all 52 Cards and print them in four columns of 13 Cards each. 

印出我的每一張牌是多少


Line 16 deals one Card object by invoking ```myDeckOfCards```’s ```dealCard``` method, then displays the Card left justified in a field of 19 characters. 


When a Card is output as a String, the Card’s ```toString``` method (lines 17–20 of Fig. 7.9) is implicitly invoked.

Lines 18–19 start a new line after every four Cards.

```java
// Fig. 7.11: DeckOfCardsTest.java
// Card shuffling and dealing.
public class DeckOfCardsTest
{
    // execute application
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        DeckOfCards myDeckOfCards = new DeckOfCards();
        myDeckOfCards.shuffle(); // place Cards in random order
        // print all 52 Cards in the order in which they are dealt
        for (int i = 1; i <= 52; i++)
        {
        // deal and display a Card
            System.out.printf("%-19s", myDeckOfCards.dealCard());
        if (i % 4 == 0) // output a newline after every fourth card
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
} // end class DeckOfCardsT
```


### Preventing NullPointerExceptions
In Fig. 7.10, we created a ```deck``` array of 52 Card references—each element of every reference-type array created with new is default initialized to null. 

在 deck array 一開始被建立的時候, elements 都是 null

Reference-type variables which are fields of a class are also initialized to null by default. 

Reference-type variables 一開始 new 的時候都是 null

A ```NullPointerException``` occurs when you try to call a method on a null reference. 

當 call a null reference, ```NullPointerException``` 就會發生

In industrial-strength code, ensuring that references are not null before you use them to call methods prevents ```NullPointerExceptions```.
