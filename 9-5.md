# 9.5 Constructors in Subclasses
As we explained, instantiating a subclass object begins a chain of constructor calls in which
the subclass constructor, before performing its own tasks, explicitly uses super to call one of
the constructors in its direct superclass or implicitly calls the superclass's default or no-argument constructor. 

- use super to call constructors implicitly or explicitly
- subclass constructor
- instantiate a subclass object

Similarly, if the superclass is derived from another class — true of every
class except `Object` — the superclass constructor invokes the constructor of the next class up
the hierarchy, and so on. 



The last constructor called in the chain is always `Object`’s constructor. 

- 最後一個 constructor 一定是 Object's constructor

The original subclass constructor’s body finishes executing last. 



Each superclass’s constructor manipulates the superclass instance variables that the subclass object inherits. 



For
example, consider again the `CommissionEmployee` – `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` hierarchy from Figs. 9.10–9.11. 


When an app creates a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` object, its
constructor is called. 

- when an app create an object
- its constructor is called

That constructor calls `CommissionEmployee`’s constructor, which in
turn calls `Object`’s constructor. 

- 那一個 constructor 會 call 上一層 parent 的 constructor,
- 最後 constructor 一定會呼叫 `Object`'s constructor


Class `Object`’s constructor has an empty body, so it immediately returns control to `CommissionEmployee`’s constructor, which then initializes the
`CommissionEmployee` instance variables that are part of the `BasePlusCommissionEmployee`
object. 

- 因為 Object's constructor 是空的
- 所以會 return 空的到 第二個 constructor
- 然後第二個 class 再 initalize instance variables

When `CommissionEmployee`’s constructor completes execution, it returns control to
`BasePlusCommissionEmployee`’s constructor, which initializes the `baseSalary`.

- 然後第二個 class  initalize instance variables 之後
- 會完成 constructor 的程序
- 然後再 return control 給第三層的 `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` constructor

### Software Engineering Observation 9.9
Java ensures that even if a constructor does not assign a value to an instance variable, the
variable is still initialized to its default value (e.g., 0 for primitive numeric types, false
for booleans, null for references).

- java 會確保 constructor 不會 assign a value to an instance variable
- variable 會保持 default value
