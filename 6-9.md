# 6.9 Case Study: Secure Random-Number Generation
We now take a brief diversion into a popular type of programming application—simulation and game playing. 

In this and the next section, we develop a game-playing program
with multiple methods. 

The program uses most of the control statements presented thus far in the book and introduces several new programming concepts.

The element of chance can be introduced in a program via an object of class SecureRandom (package java.security). 

Such objects can produce random boolean, byte, float, double, int, long and Gaussian values. 

In the next several examples, we use objects of class SecureRandom to produce random values.


### Moving to Secure Random Numbers
Recent editions of this book used Java’s Random class to obtain “random” values. 

This class produced deterministic values that could be predicted by malicious programmers. 

SecureRandom objects produce nondeterministic random numbers that cannot be predicted.

SecureRandom 不會被破解，會有真正的亂數


Deterministic random numbers have been the source of many software security breaches. 

Most programming languages now have library features similar to Java’s Secure Random class for producing nondeterministic random numbers to help prevent such problems. 

From this point forward in the text, when we refer to “random numbers” we mean
“secure random numbers".

### Creating a SecureRandom Object
A new secure random-number generator object can be created as follows:

It can then be used to generate random values — we discuss only random int values here.

```java
SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
```

For more information on the SecureRandom class, see docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/
api/java/security/SecureRandom.html.

### Obtaining a Random int Value
Consider the following statement:

```java
int randomValue = randomNumbers.nextInt();
```

SecureRandom method nextInt generates a random int value. 

SecureRandom.nextInt() 可以產生 int 的 random number

If it truly produces values at random, then every value in the range should have an equal chance (or probability) of being chosen each time nextInt is called.

如果是真正的 random, 每一個數字的機率應該都一樣


### Changing the Range of Values Produced By nextInt
The range of values produced by method nextInt generally differs from the range of values required in a particular Java application. 

每一個 application 都需要不同的 range

For example, a program that simulates coin tossing might require only 0 for “heads” and 1 for “tails.”

假如丟硬幣只要 0 or 1

A program that simulates the rolling of a six-sided die might require random integers in the range 1–6. 

骰子就要 1-6

A program that randomly predicts the next type of spaceship (out of four possibilities) that will fly across the horizon in a video game might require random integers in the range 1–4. 

For cases like these, class SecureRandom provides another version of method nextInt that receives an
int argument and returns a value from 0 up to, but not including, the argument’s value.

For example, for coin tossing, the following statement returns 0 or 1.

```java
int randomValue = randomNumbers.nextInt(2);
```

丟硬幣只要 0 跟 1, 所以 2 個數字

### Rolling a Six-Sided Die

To demonstrate random numbers, let’s develop a program that simulates 20 rolls of a sixsided die and displays the value of each roll. 

We begin by using nextInt to produce random values in the range 0–5, as follows:

```java
int face = randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
```

The argument 6—called the scaling factor—represents the number of unique values that
nextInt should produce (in this case six—0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). 

This manipulation is called scaling the range of values produced by SecureRandom method nextInt.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1–6 on its faces, not 0–5. 

So we shift the range of numbers produced by adding a shifting value—in this case 1—to our previous result, as in

因為骰子是 1-6,但上面的 face 是產生 0-5, 所以要加 1

```java
int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
```

The shifting value (1) specifies the first value in the desired range of random integers. The
preceding statement assigns face a random integer in the range 1–6.

### Rolling a Six-Sided Die 20 Times

要轉骰子 20 次

Figure 6.6 shows two sample outputs which confirm that the results of the preceding calculation are integers in the range 1–6, and that each run of the program can produce a
different sequence of random numbers. 

Line 3 imports class SecureRandom from the java.security package. 

Line 10 creates the SecureRandom object randomNumbers to produce random values. Line 16 executes 20 times in a loop to roll the die. 

The if statement (lines 21–22) in the loop starts a new line of output after every five numbers to create a neat, five-column format.

```java
// Fig. 6.6: RandomIntegers.java
// Shifted and scaled random integers.
public class RandomIntegers {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {       
    // loop 20 times
        for (int counter = 1; counter <= 20; counter++)
        {
            // pick random integer from 1 to 6
            int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
            System.out.printf("%d ", face); // display generated value
            // if counter is divisible by 5, start a new line of output
            if (counter % 5 == 0)
                System.out.println();
        }
    }
} // end class RandomIntegers
```
