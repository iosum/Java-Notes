# 6.9 Case Study: Secure Random-Number Generation
We now take a brief diversion into a popular type of programming application—simulation and game playing. 

In this and the next section, we develop a game-playing program
with multiple methods. 

The program uses most of the control statements presented thus far in the book and introduces several new programming concepts.

The element of chance can be introduced in a program via an object of class SecureRandom (package java.security). 

Such objects can produce random boolean, byte, float, double, int, long and Gaussian values. 

In the next several examples, we use objects of class SecureRandom to produce random values.


### Moving to Secure Random Numbers
Recent editions of this book used Java’s Random class to obtain “random” values. 

This class produced deterministic values that could be predicted by malicious programmers. 

SecureRandom objects produce nondeterministic random numbers that cannot be predicted.

SecureRandom 不會被破解，會有真正的亂數


Deterministic random numbers have been the source of many software security breaches. 

Most programming languages now have library features similar to Java’s Secure Random class for producing nondeterministic random numbers to help prevent such problems. 

From this point forward in the text, when we refer to “random numbers” we mean
“secure random numbers".

### Creating a SecureRandom Object
A new secure random-number generator object can be created as follows:

It can then be used to generate random values — we discuss only random int values here.

```java
SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
```

For more information on the SecureRandom class, see docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/
api/java/security/SecureRandom.html.

### Obtaining a Random int Value
Consider the following statement:

```java
int randomValue = randomNumbers.nextInt();
```

SecureRandom method nextInt generates a random int value. 

SecureRandom.nextInt() 可以產生 int 的 random number

If it truly produces values at random, then every value in the range should have an equal chance (or probability) of being chosen each time nextInt is called.

如果是真正的 random, 每一個數字的機率應該都一樣


### Changing the Range of Values Produced By nextInt
The range of values produced by method nextInt generally differs from the range of values required in a particular Java application. 

每一個 application 都需要不同的 range

For example, a program that simulates coin tossing might require only 0 for “heads” and 1 for “tails.”

假如丟硬幣只要 0 or 1

A program that simulates the rolling of a six-sided die might require random integers in the range 1–6. 

骰子就要 1-6

A program that randomly predicts the next type of spaceship (out of four possibilities) that will fly across the horizon in a video game might require random integers in the range 1–4. 

For cases like these, class SecureRandom provides another version of method nextInt that receives an
int argument and returns a value from 0 up to, but not including, the argument’s value.

For example, for coin tossing, the following statement returns 0 or 1.

```java
int randomValue = randomNumbers.nextInt(2);
```

丟硬幣只要 0 跟 1, 所以 2 個數字

### Rolling a Six-Sided Die

To demonstrate random numbers, let’s develop a program that simulates 20 rolls of a sixsided die and displays the value of each roll. 

We begin by using nextInt to produce random values in the range 0–5, as follows:

```java
int face = randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
```

The argument 6—called the scaling factor—represents the number of unique values that
nextInt should produce (in this case six—0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). 

This manipulation is called scaling the range of values produced by SecureRandom method nextInt.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1–6 on its faces, not 0–5. 

So we shift the range of numbers produced by adding a shifting value—in this case 1—to our previous result, as in

因為骰子是 1-6,但上面的 face 是產生 0-5, 所以要加 1

```java
int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
```

The shifting value (1) specifies the first value in the desired range of random integers. The
preceding statement assigns face a random integer in the range 1–6.

### Rolling a Six-Sided Die 20 Times

要轉骰子 20 次

Figure 6.6 shows two sample outputs which confirm that the results of the preceding calculation are integers in the range 1–6, and that each run of the program can produce a
different sequence of random numbers. 

Line 3 imports class SecureRandom from the java.security package. 

Line 10 creates the SecureRandom object randomNumbers to produce random values. Line 16 executes 20 times in a loop to roll the die. 

The if statement (lines 21–22) in the loop starts a new line of output after every five numbers to create a neat, five-column format.

```java
// Fig. 6.6: RandomIntegers.java
// Shifted and scaled random integers.
public class RandomIntegers {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {       
    // loop 20 times
        for (int counter = 1; counter <= 20; counter++)
        {
            // pick random integer from 1 to 6
            int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
            System.out.printf("%d ", face); // display generated value
            // if counter is divisible by 5, start a new line of output
            if (counter % 5 == 0)
                System.out.println();
        }
    }
} // end class RandomIntegers
```

### Rolling a Six-Sided Die 6,000,000 Times
To show that the numbers produced by nextInt occur with approximately equal likelihood, let’s simulate 6,000,000 rolls of a die with the application in Fig. 6.7. 

Each integer from 1 to 6 should appear approximately 1,000,000 times.

```java
// Fig. 6.7: RollDie.java
// Roll a six-sided die 6,000,000 times.
import java.security.SecureRandom;
public class RollDie {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    // randomNumbers object will produce secure random numbers
    SecureRandom randomNumbers = new SecureRandom();
    int frequency1 = 0; // count of 1s rolled
    int frequency2 = 0; // count of 2s rolled
    int frequency3 = 0; // count of 3s rolled
    int frequency4 = 0; // count of 4s rolled
    int frequency5 = 0; // count of 5s rolled
    int frequency6 = 0; // count of 6s rolled
    // tally counts for 6,000,000 rolls of a die
    for (int roll = 1; roll <= 6000000; roll++) {
        int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // number from 1 to 6
    // use face value 1-6 to determine which counter to increment
        switch (face) {
            case 1:
            ++frequency1; // increment the 1s counter
            break;
            case 2:
            ++frequency2; // increment the 2s counter
            break;
            case 3:
            ++frequency3; // increment the 3s counter
            break;
            case 4:
            ++frequency4; // increment the 4s counter
            break;
            case 5:
            ++frequency5; // increment the 5s counter
            break;
            case 6:
            ++frequency6; // increment the 6s counter
            break;
        }
    }
    System.out.println("Face\tFrequency"); // output headers
    System.out.printf("1\t%d%n2\t%d%n3\t%d%n4\t%d%n5\t%d%n6\t%d%n",
    frequency1, frequency2, frequency3, frequency4,
    frequency5, frequency6);
    }
} // end class RollDie

```

As the sample outputs show, scaling and shifting the values produced by ```nextInt```
enables the program to simulate rolling a six-sided die. 

用 nextInt 去讓骰子可以變數字 1 - 6

The application uses nested control statements (the switch is nested inside the for) to determine the number of times each side of the die appears. 

用 switch 去決定哪一面要做甚麼事情

The for statement (lines 20–46) iterates 6,000,000 times. 

for 執行 600 萬次


During each iteration, line 22 produces a random value from 1 to 6. 

```int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6); // number from 1 to 6```

That value is then used as the controlling expression (line 25) of the switch statement (lines 25–45).

可以根據這一個 value 去 control switch statement

Based on the face value, the switch statement increments one of the six counter variables during each iteration of the loop. 

只要哪一面的數字骰到 counter++

This switch statement has no default case, because we have a case for every possible die value that the expression in line 22 could produce. 

這一個並沒有 default case, 因為我們設想好全部的 case 了

Run the program, and observe the results. 

As you’ll see, every time you run this program, it produces different results.

When we study arrays in Chapter 7, we’ll show an elegant way to replace the entire
switch statement in this program with a single statement. 

array 可以用一個 single statement 取代一整個 switch statement 


### Generalized Scaling and Shifting of Random Numbers
Previously, we simulated the rolling of a six-sided die with the statement

```java
int face = 1 + randomNumbers.nextInt(6);
```

This statement always assigns to variable face an integer in the range 1 ≤ face ≤ 6. 

face 會永遠介於 1-6 之間

The width of this range (i.e., the number of consecutive integers in the range) is 6, and the starting number in the range is 1. 

In the preceding statement, the width of the range is determined by the number 6 that’s passed as an argument to ```SecureRandom``` method ```nextInt```, and the starting number of the range is the number 1 that’s added to randomNumbers.nextInt(6). 

We can generalize this result as

```java
int number = shiftingValue + randomNumbers.nextInt(scalingFactor);
```

可以把 face 的 1 用 shiftingValue 取代，把 6 用 scalingFactor 取代，這樣就可以變得比較靈活

where ```shiftingValue``` specifies the first number in the desired range of consecutive integers
and ```scalingFactor``` specifies how many numbers are in the range.


It’s also possible to choose integers at random from sets of values other than ranges of
consecutive integers. 

可以不用一直 +1, 或者是從 0 開始

For example, to obtain a random value from the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11
and 14, you could use the statement

```java
int number = 2 + 3 * randomNumbers.nextInt(5);
```

In this case, ```randomNumbers.nextInt(5)``` produces values in the range 0 – 4. 

Each value produced is multiplied by 3 to produce a number in the sequence 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12. 

We add 2 to that value to shift the range of values and obtain a value from the sequence 2, 5,
8, 11 and 14. 

We can generalize this result as

```java
int number = shiftingValue +
differenceBetweenValues * randomNumbers.nextInt(scalingFactor);
```

shiftingValue: 從哪一個數字開始
differenceBetweenValues : 公差是多少
scalingFactor : 總共要幾個數字

where ```shiftingValue``` specifies the first number in the desired range of values, ```differenceBetweenValues``` represents the constant difference between consecutive numbers in the sequence and ```scalingFactor``` specifies how many numbers are in the range.


### A Note About Performance
Using ```SecureRandom``` instead of Random to achieve higher levels of security incurs a significant performance penalty.

For “casual” applications, you might want to use class Randomfrom package java.util—simply replace SecureRandom with Random.
