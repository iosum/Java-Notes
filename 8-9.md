# 8.9 enum Types

In Fig. 6.8, we introduced the basic enum type, which defines a set of constants represented
as unique identifiers. 

-   enum : a set of constants

In that program the enum constants represented the game’s status. 

In this section we discuss the relationship between enum types and classes. 

Like classes, all enum types are reference types. 

-   全部的 enum types 都是 reference types

An enum type is declared with an enum declaration, which is
a comma-separated list of enum constants—the declaration may optionally include other
components of traditional classes, such as constructors, fields and methods (as you’ll see
momentarily). 

Each enum declaration declares an enum class with the following restrictions:

1.  enum constants are **implicitly** `final`.
2.  enum constants are **implicitly** `static`.
3.  Any attempt to create an object of an enum type with operator new results in a
    compilation error.

The enum constants can be used anywhere constants can be used, such as in the case labels
of switch statements and to control enhanced for statements.

### Declaring Instance Variables, a Constructor and Methods in an enum Type

Figure 8.10 demonstrates instance variables, a constructor and methods in an enum type.

The `enum` declaration (lines 5–37) contains two parts—the enum constants and the other
members of the enum type. 

```java
// Fig. 8.10: Book.java
// Declaring an enum type with a constructor and explicit instance fields
// and accessors for these fields
public enum Book
{
    // declare constants of enum type
    JHTP("Java How to Program", "2015"),
    CHTP("C How to Program", "2013"),
    IW3HTP("Internet & World Wide Web How to Program", "2012"),
    CPPHTP("C++ How to Program", "2014"),
    VBHTP("Visual Basic How to Program", "2014"),
    CSHARPHTP("Visual C# How to Program", "2014");

    // instance fields
    private final String title; // book title
    private final String copyrightYear; // copyright year
    
    // enum constructor
    Book(String title, String copyrightYear) {
        this.title = title;
        this.copyrightYear = copyrightYear;
    }
    // accessor for field title
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    // accessor for field copyrightYear
    public String getCopyrightYear() {
        return copyrightYear;
    }
}
// end enum Book
```

The first part (lines 8–13) declares six constants. 

```java
    // declare constants of enum type
    JHTP("Java How to Program", "2015"),
    CHTP("C How to Program", "2013"),
    IW3HTP("Internet & World Wide Web How to Program", "2012"),
    CPPHTP("C++ How to Program", "2014"),
    VBHTP("Visual Basic How to Program", "2014"),
    CSHARPHTP("Visual C# How to Program", "2014");
```

-   定義 6 個 constants

Each is optionally followed by arguments that are passed to the enum constructor (lines 20–24). 

```java
    // enum constructor
    Book(String title, String copyrightYear) {
        this.title = title;
        this.copyrightYear = copyrightYear;
    }
```

-   enum 的 constructor

Like the constructors you’ve seen in classes, an enum constructor can specify any number of parameters and can be overloaded. 

-   enum constructors 可以被 overloaded

In this example, the enum constructor requires two String
parameters. 

To properly initialize each enum constant, we follow it with parentheses containing two String arguments. 

The second part (lines 16–36) declares the other members of the enum type—two instance variables (lines 16–17), a constructor (lines 20–24) and two methods (lines 27–30 and 33–36).

-   enum 跟 classes 一樣, 有 constructors, methods

Lines 16–17 declare the instance variables `title` and `copyrightYear`. 

```java
// instance fields
private final String title; // book title
private final String copyrightYear; // copyright year
```

Each enum constant in enum type Book is actually an object of enum type Book that has its own copy of
instance variables `title` and `copyrightYear`. 

-   each constant is an object of enum type

The constructor (lines 20–24) takes two
String parameters, one that specifies the book’s title and one that specifies its copyright
year. 

```java
// enum constructor
Book(String title, String copyrightYear)
{
    this.title = title;
    this.copyrightYear = copyrightYear;
}
```

Lines 22–23 assign these parameters to the instance variables. 

```java
    this.title = title;
    this.copyrightYear = copyrightYear;
```

Lines 27–36 declare methods, which return the book title and copyright year, respectively.

```java
    // accessor for field title
    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }
    // accessor for field copyrightYear
    public String getCopyrightYear() {
        return copyrightYear;
    }
```

### Using enum type Book

Figure 8.11 tests the enum type `Book` and illustrates how to iterate through a range of enum
constants. 

```java
// Fig. 8.11: EnumTest.java
// Testing enum type Book.
import java.util.EnumSet;
public class EnumTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("All books:");
    // print all books in enum Book
    for (Book book : Book.values())
        System.out.printf("%-10s%-45s%s%n", book, book.getTitle(),  book.getCopyrightYear())
    
    System.out.printf("%nDisplay a range of enum constants:%n");
    
    for (Book book : EnumSet.range(Book.JHTP, Book.CPPHTP))
        System.out.printf("%-10s%-45s%s%n", book, book.getTitle(), book.getCopyrightYear());
    }
} // end class EnumTest
```

For every enum, the compiler generates the ```static``` method values (called in
line 12) that returns an array of the enum’s constants in the order they were declared. 

```java 
for (Book book : Book.values())
```

- the compiler 會自動產生一個 static method called ```values```, 會 return an array, 裡面是 enum's constants, 這些 constants 會按照我們當初所設定的排序好


Lines 12–14 use the enhanced for statement to display all the constants declared in the enum
Book.

```java
System.out.printf("%-10s%-45s%s%n", book, book.getTitle(),  book.getCopyrightYear())
```

Line 14 invokes the enum Book’s ```getTitle``` and ```getCopyrightYear``` methods to get
the title and copyright year associated with the constant. 



When an enum constant is converted to a String (e.g., book in line 13), the constant’s identifier is used as the String representation (e.g., JHTP for the first enum constant).

- 當 enum 被 convert to a String, constant's identifier 會被當作 String


Lines 19–21 use the ```static``` method range of class ```EnumSet``` (declared in package
java.util) to display a range of the enum Book’s constants. 

```java
    for (Book book : EnumSet.range(Book.JHTP, Book.CPPHTP))
        System.out.printf("%-10s%-45s%s%n", book, book.getTitle(), book.getCopyrightYear());
```


- 這裡使用一個 ```EnumSet.range()``` (ClassName.methodName), 表示這一個 method 是 static

Method range takes two parameters—the first and the last enum constants in the range—and returns an ```EnumSet``` that contains all the constants between these two constants, inclusive. 

- 會 return ```EnumSet```, 裡面會包括這 2 個參數之間的所有東西 (參數也會在 ```EnumSet``` 裡面)


For example, the expression ```EnumSet.range(Book.JHTP, Book.CPPHTP)``` returns an ```EnumSet``` containing
```Book.JHTP, Book.CHTP, Book.IW3HTP and Book.CPPHTP.``` T

The enhanced for statement can be used with an ```EnumSet``` just as it can with an array, so lines 12–14 use it to display the
title and copyright year of every book in the EnumSet. 

- enhanced for 可以被 ```EnumSet``` 所使用


Class ```EnumSet``` provides several other ```static``` methods for creating sets of enum constants from the same enum type.


### Common Programming Error 8.4
In an enum declaration, it’s a syntax error to declare enum constants after the enum type’s
constructors, fields and methods.

- constants 要定義在最前面, 才不會出現 error
