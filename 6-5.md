# 6-5 Notes on Declaring and Using Methods

There are three ways to call a method:

1. Using a method name by itself to call another method of the same class—such as
maximum(number1, number2, number3) in line 21 of Fig. 6.3.

直接呼叫函數


2. Using a variable that contains a reference to an object, followed by a dot (.) and
the method name to call a non-static method of the referenced object—such as
the method call in line 16 of Fig. 3.2, myAccount.getName(), which calls a method of class Account from the main method of AccountTest. Non-static methods are typically called instance methods.

不是 static method 的可以用 . 來呼叫函數

3. Using the class name and a dot (.) to call a static method of a class—such as
Math.sqrt(900.0) in Section 6.3.

用 class name 和 . 去呼叫 static method


A static method can call other static methods of the same class directly (i.e., using
the method name by itself) and can manipulate static variables in the same class directly.

static method 可以呼叫另外一個 static method (這2個要再 same class), 然後可以控制 static variables(這個也要在 same class)



To access the class’s instance variables and instance methods, a static method must use
a reference to an object of the class. 

??? 想要得到 class 實體化的變數和 method, 這一個 static method 必定要用 class 在 object 的地址

---

Instance methods can access all fields (static variables
and instance variables) and methods of the class.

實體化後的 method, 可以接觸全部的 fields(static 和 instance variable 還有 methods)

---

Recall that static methods relate to a class as a whole, whereas instance methods are
associated with a specific instance (object) of the class and may manipulate the instance
variables of that object. 

static method 只有 relate to a class, 但是 instance methods 只能對特定的 object 才可以 manipulate 那一個 object 的 variable

---


Many objects of a class, each with its own copies of the instance
variables, may exist at the same time. 

?

---


Suppose a static method were to invoke an instance
method directly. 

假設現在 static method 要被實體的 method 呼叫

---

How would the static method know which object’s instance variables
to manipulate? 

那麼這一個 static method 要怎麼知道哪一個 object 去操作實體變數?

---


What would happen if no objects of the class existed at the time the
instance method was invoked? 

會不會發生一種情況就是沒有object 存在的時候 instance method 被觸發?

---

Thus, Java does not allow a static method to directly
access instance variables and instance methods of the same class.

所以 java 不允許 static method 直接 access 在相同 class 的 instance variables and methods 

---

There are three ways to return control to the statement that calls a method. 

有 3 種方法可以 return control to the statement

---

If the method does not return a result, control returns when the program flow reaches the
method-ending right brace or when the statement is executed. 


如果 method 並沒有 return 一個 result, control 會 return 當程式碼結束的時候

```
return;
```

---

If the method returns a result, the statement evaluates the expression, then returns the result to the caller.

```
return expression;
```


假設 method 有 return 一個結果， statement 會 return to a caller.
