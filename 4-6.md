# 4.6 if…else Double-Selection Statement

The if single-selection statement performs an indicated action only when the condition
is true; otherwise, the action is skipped.

if condition == true, 執行action,
如果 condition == false, 跳過 action

---

The if…else double-selection statement allows
you to specify an action to perform when the condition is true and another action when
the condition is false. 

For example, the pseudocode statement

```
If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60
    Print “Passed”
Else
    Print “Failed”
```

prints “Passed” if the student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60, but prints “Failed” if it’s less than 60. 

if 成績 >=60, condition == true, 會 print passed, 如果 成績 < 60, condition == false, 會 print failed.

---

In either case, after printing occurs, the next pseudocode statement in sequence is “performed.”

The preceding If…Else pseudocode statement can be written in Java as

```java
if (grade >= 60)
    System.out.println("Passed");
else
    System.out.println("Failed");
```

The body of the else is also indented. 

Whatever indentation convention you choose
should be applied consistently throughout your programs.

### Nested if…else Statements


A program can test multiple cases by placing if…else statements inside other if…else
statements to create nested if…else statements. 


![nested-if-else-flowchart](/img/nested_ifelse_flowchart.png)


For example, the following pseudocode represents a nested if…else that prints A for exam grades greater than or equal to
90, B for grades 80 to 89, C for grades 70 to 79, D for grades 60 to 69 and F for all other
grades:

```
If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 90
    Print “A”
    else
        If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 80
            Print “B”
        else
            If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 70
                Print “C”
            else
                If student’s grade is greater than or equal to 60
                    Print “D”
                else
                    Print “F”
```

This pseudocode may be written in Java as

```java
if (studentGrade >= 90)
    System.out.println("A");
    else
        if (studentGrade >= 80)
            System.out.println("B");
        else
            if (studentGrade >= 70)
                System.out.println("C");
            else
                if (studentGrade >= 60)
                    System.out.println("D");
                else
                    System.out.println("F");
```

---

If variable studentGrade is greater than or equal to 90, the first four conditions in the nested if…else statement will be true, but only the statement in the if part of the first
if…else statement will execute. 

studentGrade >= 90, 第一個 if condition==true, print A,

執行完後會跑到括弧外的 statement 繼續執行別的東西


After that statement executes, the else part of the “outermost” if…else statement is skipped. 

Many programmers prefer to write the preceding nested if…else statement as

```java
if (studentGrade >= 90)
    System.out.println("A");
else if (studentGrade >= 80)
    System.out.println("B");
else if (studentGrade >= 70)
    System.out.println("C");
else if (studentGrade >= 60)
    System.out.println("D");
else
    System.out.println("F");
```

The two forms are identical except for the spacing and indentation, which the compiler ignores. 

The latter form avoids deep indentation of the code to the right. 

Such indentation often leaves little room on a line of source code, forcing lines to be split.

2種寫法一樣，第二種比較常寫

### Dangling-else Problem

The Java compiler always associates an else with the immediately preceding if unless told to do otherwise by the placement of braces ({ and }). 

This behavior can lead to what is referred to as the dangling-else problem. 


dngling-else: {} 擺放的位置

For example,

```java
if (x > 5)
    if (y > 5)
        System.out.println("x and y are > 5");
else
    System.out.println("x is <= 5");
```

appears to indicate that if x is greater than 5, the nested if statement determines whether y is also greater than 5. 

If so, the string "x and y are > 5" is output. 

上面的好像覺得 if(x>5 && y>5) 印出 x and y are > 5
else x<= 5

---

Otherwise, it appears that if x is not greater than 5, the else part of the if…else outputs the string "x is <= 5".

Beware! This nested if…else statement does not execute as it appears. The compiler actually interprets the statement as

```java
if (x > 5)
    if (y > 5)
        System.out.println("x and y are > 5");
    else
        System.out.println("x is <= 5");
```

但是其實 compiler 會這樣看，最後面的 else 是跟最靠近的 if 在一起的

in which the body of the first if is a nested if…else. 


---

The outer if statement tests whether x is greater than 5. 

If so, execution continues by testing whether y is also greater than 5. 

If the second condition is true, the proper string—"x and y are > 5"—is displayed. 

However, if the second condition is false, the string "x is <= 5" is displayed, even though we know that x is greater than 5. 

這個顯示要 x>5 && y>5 會顯示 "x and y are > 5"
else x>5 && y<5 才會顯示"x is <= 5"


---

Equally bad, if the outer if statement’s condition is false, the inner
if…else is skipped and nothing is displayed.

To force the nested if…else statement to execute as it was originally intended, we must write it as follows:

```java
if (x > 5)
{
    if (y > 5)
        System.out.println("x and y are > 5");
}
else
    System.out.println("x is <= 5");
```
The braces indicate that the second if is in the body of the first and that the else is
associated with the first if. 

Exercises 4.27–4.28 investigate the dangling-else problem
further.


### Blocks

The if statement normally expects only one statement in its body. 

To include several statements in the body of an if (or the body of an else for an if…else statement), enclose the statements in braces. 

Statements contained in a pair of braces (such as the body of a method) form a block. 

2 個以上 statement, 用 {} 包起來



---

A block can be placed anywhere in a method that a single statement
can be placed.

The following example includes a block in the else part of an if…else statement:

```java
if (grade >= 60)
    System.out.println("Passed");
else
{
    System.out.println("Failed");
    System.out.println("You must take this course again.");
}
```
In this case, if grade is less than 60, the program executes both statements in the body of the else and prints

```
Failed
You must take this course again.
```

Note the braces surrounding the two statements in the else clause. 

These braces are important. 

Without the braces, the statement


```java
System.out.println("You must take this course again.");
```

would be outside the body of the else part of the if…else statement and would execute regardless of whether the grade was less than 60.

如果沒有 {}, 只會印出一行

---

Syntax errors (e.g., when one brace in a block is left out of the program) are caught by the compiler. 

A logic error (e.g., when both braces in a block are left out of the program)
has its effect at execution time. 

A fatal logic error causes a program to fail and terminate prematurely. 

A nonfatal logic error allows a program to continue executing but causes it
to produce incorrect results.

Just as a block can be placed anywhere a single statement can be placed, it’s also possible to have an empty statement. 

Recall from Section 2.8 that the empty statement is represented by placing a semicolon (;) where a statement would normally be.

### Conditional Operator (?:)

Java provides the conditional operator (?:) that can be used in place of an if…else statement. 

This can make your code shorter and clearer. 

?: 可以讓 code shorter 和 cleaner

---

The conditional operator is Java’s only ternary operator (i.e., an operator that takes three operands). 

ternary operator: 三個運算子，java 唯一有3個運算子的 operator

---

Together, the operands and the ?: symbol form a conditional expression. 

The first operand (to the left of the ?) is a boolean expression (i.e., a condition that evaluates to a boolean value—true or
false), 

第一個 part, ? 左邊，代表 condition, boolean expression, true or false

---

the second operand (between the ? and :) is the value of the conditional expression if the boolean expression is true 

第二個 part, ? : 中間，表示 condition == true 的 statement

---

and the third operand (to the right of the :) is the value of the conditional expression if the boolean expression evaluates to false.

第三 part, : 右邊，表示 condition == false 的 statement

---


For example, the statement


```java
System.out.println(studentGrade >= 60 ? "Passed" : "Failed");
```

prints the value of println’s conditional-expression argument. 

The conditional expression in this statement evaluates to the string "Passed" if the boolean expression studentGrade >= 60 is true and to the string "Failed" if it’s false.


```java
if(studentGrade >= 60) {
    "Passed";
}
else {
    "Failed";
}
```

---

Thus, this statement with the conditional operator performs essentially the same function as the if…else statement shown earlier in this section. 

The precedence of the conditional operator is low, so the entire conditional expression is normally placed in parentheses. 

We’ll see that conditional expressions can be used in some situations where if…else statements cannot.
