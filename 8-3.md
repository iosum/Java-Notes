# 8.3 Controlling Access to Members

The access modifiers ```public``` and ```private``` control access to a class’s variables and methods.

In Chapter 9, we’ll introduce the additional access modifier ```protected```. The primary purpose of ```public``` methods is to present to the class’s clients a view of the services the class
provides (i.e., the class’s public interface). 

- public method: 給 class 的 clients 看有哪一些 services that class provides


Clients need not be concerned with how the class accomplishes its tasks. 
For this reason, the class’s ```private``` variables and ```private``` methods (i.e., its implementation details) are not accessible to its clients.

- clients 並不需要知道 class 怎麼完成那一些 function的, 所以使用 private variable 和 private method 可以保護自己, 並不需要讓別人知道太多的細節

Figure 8.3 demonstrates that ```private``` class members are not accessible outside the
class. 


Lines 9–11 attempt to access the private instance variables hour, minute and second of the ```Time1``` object time. 

When this program is compiled, the compiler generates error messages that these private members are not accessible. 

This program assumes that the Time1 class from Fig. 8.1 is used.

```java
// Fig. 8.3: MemberAccessTest.java
// Private members of class Time1 are not accessible.
public class MemberAccessTest
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Time1 time = new Time1(); // create and initialize Time1 object
        time.hour = 7; // error: hour has private access in Time1
        time.minute = 15; // error: minute has private access in Time1
        time.second = 30; // error: second has private access in Time1
    }
} // end class MemberAccessTest
```

#### Common Programming Error 8.1
An attempt by a method that’s not a member of a class to access a private member of that
class generates a compilation error.
