# While Repetition Statement

A repetition statement allows you to specify that a program should repeat an action while
some condition remains true. 

The pseudocode statement describes the repetition during a shopping trip. 

The condition “there are more items on my
shopping list” may be true or false. 

If it’s true, then the action “Purchase next item and cross it off my list” is performed.

This action will be performed repeatedly while the condition remains true. 

The statement(s) contained in the While repetition statement constitute its body,
which may be a single statement or a block. 

Eventually, the condition will become false
(when the shopping list’s last item has been purchased and crossed off). 

At this point, the repetition terminates, and the first statement after the repetition statement executes.

```
While there are more items on my shopping list
    Purchase next item and cross it off my list
```

As an example of Java’s while repetition statement, consider a program segment that
finds the first power of 3 larger than 100.

Suppose that the int variable product is initialized to 3. 

After the following while statement executes, product contains the result:

```java
while (product <= 100)
    product = 3 * product;
```

Each iteration of the while statement multiplies product by 3, so product takes on the
values 9, 27, 81 and 243 successively. 

When product becomes 243, product <= 100 becomes false. 

This terminates the repetition, so the final value of product is 243. 

At this point, program execution continues with the next statement after the while statement.

### UML Activity Diagram for a while Statement

The UML activity diagram in Fig. 4.6 illustrates the flow of control in the preceding
while statement. 

Once again, the symbols in the diagram (besides the initial state, transition arrows, a final state and three notes) represent an action state and a decision. 


This diagram introduces the UML’s merge symbol.

The UML represents both the merge symbol
and the decision symbol as diamonds. 

The merge symbol joins two flows of activity into one. 

In this diagram, the merge symbol joins the transitions from the initial state and from
the action state, so they both flow into the decision that determines whether the loop
should begin (or continue) executing.


The decision and merge symbols can be distinguished by the number of “incoming”
and “outgoing” transition arrows.

A decision symbol has one transition arrow pointing to the diamond and two or more pointing out from it to indicate possible transitions from that point. 

In addition, each transition arrow pointing out of a decision symbol has a guard
condition next to it. 

A merge symbol has two or more transition arrows pointing to the diamond and only one pointing from the diamond, to indicate multiple activity flows merging to continue the activity.

None of the transition arrows associated with a merge symbol has a guard condition.


Figure 4.6 clearly shows the repetition of the while statement discussed earlier in this
section. 

The transition arrow emerging from the action state points back to the merge,
from which program flow transitions back to the decision that’s tested at the beginning of
each iteration of the loop. 

The loop continues to execute until the guard condition product > 100 becomes true. 

Then the while statement exits (reaches its final state), and control passes to the next statement in sequence in the program.
