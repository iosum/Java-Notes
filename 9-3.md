# 9.3 protected Members

Chapter 8 discussed access modifiers `public` and `private`. 

A class’s public members are accessible wherever the program has a reference to an object of that class or one of its subclasses. 

- public members are accessible 不管 the program has a reference to an object 或者是其中的一個 subclasses

A class’s `private` members are accessible only within the class itself. 

- private members are accessible only within the class


In this section,
we introduce the access modifier `protected`. 



Using `protected` access offers an intermediate level of access between `public` and `private`. 



A superclass’s protected members can be
accessed by members of that superclass, by members of its subclasses and by members of
other classes in the same package — `protected` members also have package access.

- protected members have package access
- protected members can be accessed by the same package including of superclasses, of subclasses, of classes


All `public` and `protected` superclass members retain their original access modifier
when they become members of the subclass—public members of the superclass become
public members of the subclass, and protected members of the superclass become protected members of the subclass. 

superclass | subclass
------|---------
public | public
protected | protected


A superclass’s `private` members are not accessible outside
the class itself. 

superclass | subclass
-----------|-----------------
private | hidden

Rather, they’re hidden from its subclasses and can be accessed only through
the `public` or `protected` methods inherited from the superclass.

- can be accessed through `public` or `protected` method 是 inherited from the superclass


Subclass methods can refer to `public` and `protected` members inherited from the
superclass simply by using the member names. 



When a subclass method overrides an inherited superclass method, the superclass version of the method can be accessed from the subclass by preceding the superclass method name with keyword `super` and a dot (.)
separator. 

- subclass method 
- overrides an inherited superclass method
- superclass method cam be accessed
- from the subclass
- by superclass method name with `super.`


We discuss accessing overridden members of the superclass in Section 9.4.
