# 10.3 Demonstrating Polymorphic Behavior

Section 9.4 created a class hierarchy, in which class `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` inherited from `CommissionEmployee`. 

The examples in that section manipulated `CommissionEmployee` and `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` objects by using references to them to
invoke their methods—we aimed superclass variables at superclass objects and subclass
variables at subclass objects. 

These assignments are natural and straightforward — superclass variables are intended to refer to superclass objects, and subclass variables are intended
to refer to subclass objects. 

However, as you’ll soon see, other assignments are possible.

In the next example, **we aim a superclass reference at a subclass object**. 

We then show
how invoking a method on a subclass object via a superclass reference invokes the subclass
functionality — the type of the **referenced** object, not the type of the variable, determines
which method is called. 

This example demonstrates that an object of a subclass can be treated
as an object of its superclass, enabling various interesting manipulations. 

A program can create
an array of superclass variables that refer to objects of many subclass types. 

This is allowed
because each subclass object is an object of its superclass. 

For instance, we can assign the
reference of a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` object to a superclass `CommissionEmployee`
variable, because a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` is a `CommissionEmployee` — so we can
treat a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` as a `CommissionEmployee`.

-   我們可以 assign the reference of a subclass object 到 superclass variable
-   因為 subclass 就是 superclass 的一種

As you’ll learn later in the chapter, you cannot treat a superclass object as a subclass
object, because a superclass object is not an object of any of its subclasses. 

-   但是 superclass 就不一定是 subclass 的一種

For example, we
cannot assign the reference of a `CommissionEmployee` object to a subclass `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` variable, because a `CommissionEmployee` is not a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` — a `CommissionEmployee` does not have a `baseSalary` instance variable and does
not have methods `setBaseSalary` and `getBaseSalary`. 

-   因為 subclass 可能會加入他自己的 method 跟 variables

The is-a relationship applies only
up the hierarchy from a subclass to its direct (and indirect) superclasses, and not vice versa
(i.e., not down the hierarchy from a superclass to its subclasses or indirect subclasses).

The Java compiler does allow the assignment of a superclass reference to a subclass
variable if we explicitly cast the superclass reference to the subclass type. 

-   Java 允許 superclass reference assign 到 subclass variable
-   如果特別強制轉型的話

Why would we
ever want to perform such an assignment? 

A superclass reference can be used to invoke only
the methods declared in the superclass — attempting to invoke subclass-only methods
through a superclass reference results in compilation errors. 

-   superclass 變成 subclass 會導致 compilation error

If a program needs to perform
a subclass-specific operation on a subclass object referenced by a superclass variable, the
program must first cast the superclass reference to a subclass reference through a technique
known as **downcasting**. 

-   把 subclass 變成 superclass variable 叫做 **downcasting**

This enables the program to invoke subclass methods that are not
in the superclass. 

-   可以讓 program to invoke subclass methods 
-   subclass method 不是在 superclass 裡面

We demonstrate the mechanics of downcasting in Section 10.5.

### Software Engineering Observation 10.3

Although it’s allowed, you should generally avoid downcasting

The example in Fig. 10.1 demonstrates three ways to use superclass and subclass variables to store references to superclass and subclass objects. 

The first two are straightforward—as in Section 9.4, we assign a superclass reference to a superclass variable, and a
subclass reference to a subclass variable. 

Then we demonstrate the relationship between
subclasses and superclasses (i.e., the is-a relationship) by assigning a subclass reference to a
superclass variable. 

This program uses classes `CommissionEmployee` and `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` from Fig. 9.10 and Fig. 9.11, respectively.

```java
// Fig. 10.1: PolymorphismTest.java
// Assigning superclass and subclass references to superclass and
// subclass variables.
public class PolymorphismTest {
    public static void main(String\[] args) {
        // assign superclass reference to superclass variable
        CommissionEmployee commissionEmployee = new CommissionEmployee(
                "Sue", "Jones", "222-22-2222", 10000, .06);
        // assign subclass reference to subclass variable
        BasePlusCommissionEmployee basePlusCommissionEmployee =
                new BasePlusCommissionEmployee(
                        "Bob", "Lewis", "333-33-3333", 5000, .04, 300);
        // invoke toString on superclass object using superclass variable
        System.out.printf("%s %s:%n%n%s%n%n",
                "Call CommissionEmployee's toString with superclass reference ",
                "to superclass object", commissionEmployee.toString());
        // invoke toString on subclass object using subclass variable
        System.out.printf("%s %s:%n%n%s%n%n",
                "Call BasePlusCommissionEmployee's toString with subclass",
                "reference to subclass object", basePlusCommissionEmployee.toString());
        // invoke toString on subclass object using superclass variable
        CommissionEmployee commissionEmployee2 = basePlusCommissionEmployee;

        System.out.printf("%s %s:%n%n%s%n",
                "Call BasePlusCommissionEmployee's toString with superclass",
                "reference to subclass object", commissionEmployee2.toString());
    } // end main

} // end class PolymorphismTest
```

In Fig. 10.1, lines 10–11 create a `CommissionEmployee` object and assign its reference
to a `CommissionEmployee` variable. 

Lines 14–16 create a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee`
object and assign its reference to a `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` variable. 

These assignments are natural—for example, a `CommissionEmployee` variable’s primary purpose is to
hold a reference to a `CommissionEmployee` object. 

Lines 19–21 use `commissionEmployee`
to invoke `toString` explicitly. 

Because `commissionEmployee` refers to a `CommissionEmployee` object, superclass `CommissionEmployee`’s version of `toString` is called. 

Similarly,
lines 24–27 use `basePlusCommissionEmployee` to invoke `toString` explicitly on the `BasePlusCommissionEmployee` object. 

This invokes subclass `BasePlusCommissionEmployee`’s
version of `toString`.

Lines 30–31 then assign the reference of subclass object `basePlusCommissionEmployee` to a superclass `CommissionEmployee` variable, which lines 32–34 use to invoke
method `toString`. 

When a superclass variable contains a reference to a subclass object, and
that reference is used to call a method, **the subclass version of the method is called.**

-   當 a superclass variable contains a reference to a subclass object
-   superclass reference 被用來 call a method
-   subclass 的 method 會被 called

Hence,
`commissionEmployee2.toString()` in line 34 actually calls class `BasePlusCommissionEmployee`’s `toString` method. 

The Java compiler allows this “crossover” because an object
of a subclass is an object of its superclass (but not vice versa). 

-   因為 subclass 是 superclass 的一種

When the compiler encounters a method call made through a variable, the compiler determines if the method can be called by checking the variable’s class type. 

If that class contains the proper method declaration (or inherits one), the call is compiled. 

At execution time, the type of the object to
which the variable refers determines the actual method to use. 

This process, called `dynamic binding`, is discussed in detail in Section 10.5.

- 簡單的說，就是物件的行為並不是在編譯時期 (compileir-time，就已經決定了。而是在程式執行時期於(晚期)(run-time)才動態地決定的。
