# 6.7 Argument Promotion and Casting

Another important feature of method calls is argument promotion — converting an argument’s value, if possible, to the type that the method expects to receive in its corresponding
parameter. 

method 裡面也已很重要的東西是 arguments, 要把 arguments 的 data type 跟 method 所接收的參數一樣




For example, a program can call Math method sqrt with an int argument even
though a double argument is expected. 

假設有一個 program call Math 的 method, sqrt, 但是傳進去的是 int, 但事實上要放的 data type 是 double


The statement correctly evaluates Math.sqrt(4)and prints the value 2.0. 

statement 會自動把它印成 double


The method declaration’s parameter list causes Java to convert the int value 4 to the double value 4.0 before passing
the value to method sqrt. 

在傳給 method sqrt 之前會把 int 4 變成 double 4.0


Such conversions may lead to compilation errors if Java’s promotion rules are not satisfied. 

有些轉換可能會導致 compliation 的 error

These rules specify which conversions are allowed—that is, which ones can be performed without losing data. 

也些可以直接轉是因為轉了並不會失去 data

In the sqrt example above, an int is
converted to a double without changing its 
value. 

在 sqrt 裡面，int 轉 double 是不會失去 data 的

However, converting a double to an int
truncates the fractional part of the double value—thus, part of the value is lost. 

但是在 double 轉成 int 會把小數點去除，那有些 value 就會不見



Converting large integer types to small integer types (e.g., long to int, or int to short) may also result in changed values.

把大的 integer 轉成小的 integer (long -> int / int -> short) 可能會改變值


The promotion rules apply to expressions containing values of two or more primitive
types and to primitive-type values passed as arguments to methods. 



Each value is promoted to the “highest” type in the expression. 


每一個 value 都是被看成最高的 type

Actually, the expression uses a temporary
copy of each value—the types of the original values remain unchanged. 

Figure 6.4 lists the primitive types and the types to which each can be promoted. 

The valid promotions for a given type are always to a type higher in the table. 

For example, an int can be promoted
to the higher types long, float and double.

Converting values to types lower in the table of Fig. 6.4 will result in different values
if the lower type cannot represent the value of the higher type (e.g., the int value 2000000
cannot be represented as a short, and any floating-point number with digits after its
decimal point cannot be represented in an integer type such as long, int or short). 


把 lower 轉成 higher value 也不行做，小數點在整數的部分也無法表示

Therefore, in cases where information may be lost due to conversion, the Java compiler requires you to use a cast operator (introduced in Section 4.10) to explicitly force the conversion to
occur—otherwise a compilation error occurs. 

如果要轉， java 會強制叫你 cast data type

This enables you to “take control” from the
compiler. 

這樣你就可以控制 compiler

You essentially say, “I know this conversion might cause loss of information, but
for my purposes here, that’s fine.” 

表示我知道這樣的轉換可以導致 the loss of data, 所以我願意承擔風險

Suppose method square calculates the square of an integer and thus requires an int argument. 

To call square with a double argument named
doubleValue, we would be required to write the method call as

```square((int) doubleValue)```

This method call explicitly casts (converts) doubleValue’s value to a a temporary integer
for use in method square. 

Thus, if doubleValue’s value is 4.5, the method receives the value 4 and returns 16, not 20.25.
