# Formulating Algorithms: Counter-Controlled Repetition (有終止條件)

To illustrate how algorithms are developed, we solve two variations of a problem that averages student grades. 

Consider the following problem statement:
A class of ten students took a quiz. 

```
The grades (integers in the range 0–100) for this quiz are available to you. 

Determine the class average on the quiz.
```

The class average is equal to the sum of the grades divided by the number of students. 

The algorithm for solving this problem on a computer must input each grade, keep track of the total of all grades input, perform the averaging calculation and print the result.

### Pseudocode Algorithm with Counter-Controlled Repetition

Let’s use pseudocode to list the actions to execute and specify the order in which they
should execute. 

We use counter-controlled repetition to input the grades one at a time.

This technique uses a variable called a counter (or control variable) to control the number
of times a set of statements will execute. 

Counter-controlled repetition is often called ```definite repetition```, because the number of repetitions is known before the loop begins executing. 

counter-controlled repetition 通常叫做 definite repetition, 因為循環的次數是已知的

---

In this example, repetition terminates when the counter exceeds 10. 

This section presents a fully developed pseudocode algorithm (Fig. 4.7) and a corresponding Java program (Fig. 4.8) that implements the algorithm. 

In Section 4.10, we demonstrate how to
use pseudocode to develop such an algorithm from scratch.


Note the references in the algorithm of Fig. 
4.7 to a total and a counter. 

A total is a variable used to accumulate the sum of several values. 

A counter is a variable used to count—in this case, the grade counter indicates which of the 10 grades is about to be entered by the user. 

Variables used to store totals are normally initialized to zero before being used in a program.

```
Set total to zero
Set grade counter to one

While grade counter is less than or equal to ten
    Prompt the user to enter the next grade
    Input the next grade
    Add the grade into the total
    Add one to the grade counter

Set the class average to the total divided by ten
Print the class average
```

### Implementing Counter-Controlled Repetition

In Fig. 4.8, class ClassAverage’s main method (lines 7–31) implements the class-averaging
algorithm described by the pseudocode in Fig. 4.7 — it allows the user to enter 10 grades,
then calculates and displays the average.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
public class ClassAverage(){
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        int total = 0;
        int counter = 0;

        while(counter < 10) {
            // prompt
            System.out.print("Enter grade: "); 
            total += input.nextInt();
            counter++;
        }

        int average = total / 10;
        System.out.printf("%nTotal of all 10 grades is %d%n", total);
        System.out.printf("Class average is %d%n", average);
    }
}
```
