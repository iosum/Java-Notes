# Control Structures

Normally, statements in a program are executed one after the other in the order in which they’re written. 

This process is called sequential execution. 

sequential execution: program 接著一行行執行

Various Java statements, which we’ll soon discuss, enable you to specify that the next statement to execute is not necessarily the next one in sequence. 


This is called transfer of control.

transfer of control: program 不需要一行一行執行

During the 1960s, it became clear that the indiscriminate use of transfers of control
was the root of much difficulty experienced by software development groups. 

The blame was pointed at the goto statement (used in most programming languages of the time),
which allows you to specify a transfer of control to one of a wide range of destinations in
a program. 

[Note: Java does not have a goto statement; however, the word goto is reserved by Java and should not be used as an identifier in programs.]


The research of Bohm and Jacopini1 had demonstrated that programs could be written without any goto statements. 

The challenge of the era for programmers was to shift
their styles to “goto-less programming.” 

The term structured programming became
almost synonymous with “goto elimination.” 

Not until the 1970s did most programmers start taking structured programming seriously. 

The results were impressive. 

Software development groups reported shorter development times, more frequent on-time delivery
of systems and more frequent within-budget completion of software projects. 

The key to these successes was that structured programs were clearer, easier to debug and modify, and
more likely to be bug free in the first place.


Bohm and Jacopini’s work demonstrated that all programs could be written in terms of only three control structures—the sequence structure, the selection structure and the repetition structure. 

When we introduce Java’s control-structure implementations, we’ll refer to them in the terminology of the Java Language Specification as “control statements.”

### Sequence Structure in Java

The sequence structure is built into Java. 

Unless directed otherwise, the computer executes
Java statements one after the other in the order in which they’re written—that is, in sequence. The activity diagram in Fig. 

4.1 illustrates a typical sequence structure in which
two calculations are performed in order. 

Java lets you have as many actions as you want in
a sequence structure. 

As we’ll soon see, anywhere a single action may be placed, we may place several actions in sequence.

A UML activity diagram models the workflow (also called the activity) of a portion of a software system. 

Such workflows may include a portion of an algorithm, like the sequence structure in Fig. 4.1. 

Activity diagrams are composed of symbols, such as actionstate symbols (rectangles with their left and right sides replaced with outward arcs), diamonds and small circles. 

These symbols are connected by transition arrows, which represent the flow of the activity—that is, the order in which the actions should occur.

Like pseudocode, activity diagrams help you develop and represent algorithms.

Activity diagrams clearly show how control structures operate. 

We use the UML in this chapter and Chapter 5 to show control flow in control statements. 

Online Chapters 33– 34 use the UML in a real-world automated-teller-machine case study.


Consider the sequence-structure activity diagram in Fig. 4.1. 

It contains two action states, each containing an action expression—for example, “add grade to total” or “add 1 to counter”—that specifies a particular action to perform. Other actions might include
calculations or input/output operations. 

The arrows in the activity diagram represent
transitions, which indicate the order in which the actions represented by the action states
occur. 

The program that implements the activities illustrated by the diagram in Fig. 4.1
first adds grade to total, then adds 1 to counter.

The solid circle at the top of the activity diagram represents the initial state—the
beginning of the workflow before the program performs the modeled actions. 

The solid circle surrounded by a hollow circle at the bottom of the diagram represents the final
state—the end of the workflow after the program performs its actions.

Figure 4.1 also includes rectangles with the upper-right corners folded over. 

These are UML notes (like comments in Java)—explanatory remarks that describe the purpose of symbols in the diagram. 

Figure 4.1 uses UML notes to show the Java code associated with each
action state. 

A dotted line connects each note with the element it describes. 

Activity diagrams normally do not show the Java code that implements the activity. 

We do this here to illustrate how the diagram relates to Java code. 

For more information on the UML, see our optiona
online object-oriented design case study (Chapters 33–34) or visit www.uml.org.

### Selection Statements in Java

Java has three types of selection statements (discussed in this chapter and Chapter 5). 

The if statement either performs (selects) an action, if a condition is true, or skips it, if the condition is false. 

The if…else statement performs an action if a condition is true and performs a different action if the condition is false. 

The switch statement (Chapter 5) performs one of many different actions, depending on the value of an expression.

The if statement is a single-selection statement because it selects or ignores a single
action (or, as we’ll soon see, a single group of actions). 

The if…else statement is called a double-selection statement because it selects between two different actions (or groups of actions). 

The switch statement is called a multiple-selection statement because it selects among many different actions (or groups of actions).

### Repetition Statements in Java

Java provides three repetition statements (also called iteration statements or looping
statements) that enable programs to perform statements repeatedly as long as a condition
(called the loop-continuation condition) remains true. 

The repetition statements are the
while, do…while, for and enhanced for statements. 

(Chapter 5 presents the do…while
and for statements and Chapter 7 presents the enhanced for statement.) 

The while and for statements perform the action (or group of actions) in their bodies zero or more
times—if the loop-continuation condition is initially false, the action (or group of actions)
will not execute. 

The do…while statement performs the action (or group of actions) in its body one or more times. 

The words if, else, switch, while, do and for are Java keywords.

A complete list of Java keywords appears in Appendix C.
