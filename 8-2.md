# 8.2 Time Class Case Study

Our first example consists of two classes— ```Time1``` (Fig. 8.1) and ```Time1Test``` (Fig. 8.2).

Class ```Time1``` represents the time of day. 

Class ```Time1Test```’s main method creates one object of class Time1 and invokes its methods. 

The output of this program appears in Fig. 8.2.


### Time1 Class Declaration
Class ```Time1```’s `private` `int` instance variables `hour`, `minute` and `second` (lines 6–8) represent the time in universal-time format (24-hour clock format in which hours are in the
range 0–23, and minutes and seconds are each in the range 0–59). 

```java
private int hour; // 0 - 23
private int minute; // 0 - 59
private int second; // 0 - 59
```

```Time1``` contains `public` methods ```setTime``` (lines 12–25), ```toUniversalString``` (lines 28–31) and ```toString``` (lines
34–39). 

These methods are also called the *public services* or the *public interface* that the
class provides to its clients.

- `setTime`, `toUniversalString`, `toString` method 都叫做 public services or public interface



```java
// Fig. 8.1: Time1.java
// Time1 class declaration maintains the time in 24-hour format.
public class Time1
{
    private int hour; // 0 - 23
    private int minute; // 0 - 59
    private int second; // 0 - 59
// set a new time value using universal time; throw an
// exception if the hour, minute or second is invalid
public void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second)
{
    // validate hour, minute and second
    if (hour < 0 || hour >= 24 || minute < 0 || minute >= 60 || second < 0 || second >= 60) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("hour, minute and/or second was out of range");
    }
        this.hour = hour;
        this.minute = minute;
        this.second = second;
    }
    
    // convert to String in universal-time format (HH:MM:SS)
    public String toUniversalString() {
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minute, second);
    }

    // convert to String in standard-time format (H:MM:SS AM or PM)
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%d:%02d:%02d %s", ((hour == 0 || hour == 12) ? 12 : hour % 12),
        minute, second, (hour < 12 ? "AM" : "PM"));
    }
} // end class Time1
```

### Default Constructor
In this example, class ```Time1``` does not declare a constructor, so the compiler supplies a default constructor. 

沒有定義 constructor, 所以就是 default constructor


Each instance variable implicitly receives the default int value. 

Instance variables also can be initialized when they’re declared in the class body, using the same initialization syntax as with a local variable.


### Method setTime and Throwing Exceptions

Method ```setTime``` (lines 12–25) is a public method that declares three int parameters and
uses them to set the time. 

```setTime()``` 裡面有三個參數

Lines 15–16 test each argument to determine whether the value
is outside the proper range. 

防呆

```java
if (hour < 0 || hour >= 24 || minute < 0 || minute >= 60 ||
second < 0 || second >= 60)
```

The hour value must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than 24, because universal-time format represents hours as integers from 0 to 23 (e.g., 1 PM is
hour 13 and 11 PM is hour 23; midnight is hour 0 and noon is hour 12). 

Similarly, both minute and second values must be greater than or equal to 0 and less than 60. 

For values outside these ranges, ```setTime``` throws an exception of type ```IllegalArgumentException```
(lines 18–19), which notifies the client code that an invalid argument was passed to the
method. 

- 如果有不是正常範圍的數字, 那麼就會在 exception 裡面

As you learned in Section 7.5, you can use ```try...catch``` to catch exceptions and
attempt to recover from them, which we’ll do in Fig. 8.2. 

The class instance creation expression in the throw statement (Fig. 8.1; line 18) creates a new object of type ```IllegalArgumentException```. 

```java
throw new IllegalArgumentException
```
- 會 create 這一個 object 叫做 `IllegalArgumentException`

The parentheses following the class name indicate a call to the ````IllegalArgumentException```` constructor. 

```java
IllegalArgumentException()
```
- 這樣就會呼叫那一個 `IllegalArgumentException` 的 constructor

In this case, we call the constructor that allows us to specify a custom error message. 

- 可以讓我們 specity error messages

After the exception object is created, the throw statement immediately terminates method ```setime``` and the exception is returned to the calling method that attempted to set the time. 

- exception created
- throw terminates `setTime`
- exception is returned to the calling method



If the argument values are all valid, lines 22–24 assign them to the hour, minute and second instance variables.

```java
this.hour = hour;
this.minute = minute;
this.second = second;
```

### Method toUniversalString

Method ```toUniversalString``` (lines 28–31) takes no arguments and returns a String in universal-time format, consisting of two digits each for the hour, minute and second—recall that you can use the 0 flag in a printf format specification (e.g., ```"%02d"```) to display
leading zeros for a value that doesn’t use all the character positions in the specified field
width. 

```java
    // convert to String in universal-time format (HH:MM:SS)
    public String toUniversalString() {
        return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minute, second);
    }
```

1. takes no arguments
2. returns a String 
3. ```"%02d"``` : 如果是早上 8 點 8 分 8 秒, 那麼就會顯示 08:08:08, 會自動在前面補 0



For example, if the time were 1:30:07 PM, the method would return 13:30:07.

- 假如是 1:30:07 PM, 會 return 13:30:07

Line 30 uses ```static``` method format of class `String` to return a `String` containing the formatted hour, minute and second values, each with two digits and possibly a leading 0 (specified with the 0 flag). 

```java
return String.format("%02d:%02d:%02d", hour, minute, second);
```

1. String.format() - class name: String, method name: format
2. format(): 是一個 static method



Method ```format``` is similar to method ```System.out.printf``` except that format returns a formatted String rather than displaying it in a command window. 
The formatted String is returned by method ```toUniversalString```.

- format() 跟 System.out.printf 很像, 不同的地方 format() 是 return String, System.out.printf 是顯示在小黑視窗


### Method toString
Method ```toString``` (lines 34–39) takes no arguments and returns a `String` in standard-time format, consisting of the hour, minute and second values separated by colons and followed by AM or PM (e.g., 11:30:17 AM or 1:27:06 PM). 

```java
    // convert to String in standard-time format (H:MM:SS AM or PM)
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%d:%02d:%02d %s", ((hour == 0 || hour == 12) ? 12 : hour % 12),
        minute, second, (hour < 12 ? "AM" : "PM"));
    }
```
1. toString(): takes no arguments
2. String toString(): returns a String



Like method ```toUniversalString```, method ```toString``` uses `static` `String` method format to format the minute and second as twodigit values, with leading zeros if necessary. 

- ```toString``` 是一個 static String method

Line 37 uses a conditional operator (?:) to determine the value for hour in the String—if the hour is 0 or 12 (AM or PM), it appears as 12; otherwise, it appears as a value from 1 to 11. 

```java
((hour == 0 || hour == 12) ? 12 : hour % 12),
```

- 如果 hour == 0 或 hour == 12, 那麼就顯示 12, 要不然就顯示 1 到 11
- 例子: 8 % 12 == 8, 2 % 12 == 2, 所以 hour % 12 == hour


The conditional operator in line 30 determines whether AM or PM will be returned as part of the String.

```java
(hour < 12 ? "AM" : "PM")
```
- 如果 hour < 12, 表示早上


Recall all objects in Java have a ```toString``` method that returns a String representation of the object. 

We chose to return a String containing the time in standard-time format.

Method ```toString``` is called implicitly whenever a ```Time1``` object appears in the code where
a String is needed, such as the value to output with a ```%s``` format specifier in a call to
```System.out.printf```. 

- `toString` 是 implicitly 被 call, 不管 a `Time1` object 要不要用到這一個 method


You may also call ```toString``` explicitly to obtain a String representation of a Time object.


### Using Class Time1
Class ```Time1Test``` (Fig. 8.2) uses class ```Time1```.

Line 9 declares and creates a ```Time1``` object time. 

```java
Time1 time = new Time1(); // invokes Time1 constructor
```

Operator new implicitly invokes class Time1’s default constructor, because ```Time1```
does not declare any constructors. 

- 因為沒有宣告任何 constructors, 所以直接用 default constructor

To confirm that the ```Time1``` object was initialized properly, line 12 calls the private method ```displayTime``` (lines 35–39), which, in turn, calls the
Time1 object’s ```toUniversalString``` and ```toString``` methods to output the time in universal-time format and standard-time format, respectively. 

```
displayTime("After time object is created", time);
```

Note that ```toString``` could have been called implicitly here rather than explicitly. 


- 會先 call ```displayTime```, 再 call ```toUniversalString``` 和 ```toString```


Next, line 16 invokes method ```setTime``` of the time object to change the time. 
Then line 17 calls ```displayTime``` again to output the time in both formats to confirm that it was set correctly.

```java
time.setTime(13, 27, 6);
```
```
displayTime("After calling setTime", time);
```


#### Software Engineering Observation 8.2

Recall from Chapter 3 that methods declared with access modifier ```private``` can be called
only by other methods of the class in which the ```private``` methods are declared. 

Such methods are commonly referred to as utility methods or helper methods because they’re typically used to support the operation of the class’s other methods.

- 如果 method 是 private, 那麼要利用其他的 method in the same class 去 access 這一個 private method, 那麼這個其他的 method 常被叫做 utility methods 或者是 helper 


```java
// Fig. 8.2: Time1Test.java
// Time1 object used in an app.
public class Time1Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // create and initialize a Time1 object
        Time1 time = new Time1(); // invokes Time1 constructor
        // output string representations of the time
        displayTime("After time object is created", time);
        System.out.println();
        // change time and output updated time
        time.setTime(13, 27, 6);
        displayTime("After calling setTime", time);
        System.out.println();
        // attempt to set time with invalid values
        try
        {
            time.setTime(99, 99, 99); // all values out of range
        }
        catch (IllegalArgumentException e)
        {
            System.out.printf("Exception: %s%n%n", e.getMessage());
        }
            // display time after attempt to set invalid values
            displayTime("After calling setTime with invalid values", time);
        }
        // displays a Time1 object in 24-hour and 12-hour formats
        private static void displayTime(String header, Time1 t)
        {
            System.out.printf("%s%nUniversal time: %s%nStandard time: %s%n", header, t.toUniversalString() , t.toString());
        }
    }
} // end class Time1Test
```

### Calling Time1 Method setTime with Invalid Values

To illustrate that method ```setTime``` validates its arguments, line 23 calls method ```setTime```
with invalid arguments of 99 for the hour, minute and second. 

```java
time.setTime(99, 99, 99); // all values out of range
```

- 想嘗試 exception 有沒有 work, 先把 time 的值設置成 invalid

This statement is placed in a try block (lines 21–24) in case ```setTime``` throws an ```IllegalArgumentException```, which it will do since the arguments are all invalid. 


When this occurs, the exception is caught at lines 25–28, and line 27 displays the exception’s error message by calling its ```getMessage``` method. 

```java
catch (IllegalArgumentException e)
{
System.out.printf("Exception: %s%n%n", e.getMessage());
}
```

Line 31 outputs the time again in both formats to confirm that ```setTime``` did not change the time when invalid arguments were supplied.

```java
displayTime("After calling setTime with invalid values", time);
```

### Software Engineering of the Time1 Class Declaration
Consider several issues of class design with respect to class ```Time1```. 


The instance variables hour, minute and second are each declared private. 


The actual data representation used within the class is of no concern to the class’s clients. 


For example, it would be perfectly
reasonable for ```Time1``` to represent the time internally as the number of seconds since midnight or the number of minutes and seconds since midnight. 


Clients could use the same
public methods and get the same results without being aware of this. (Exercise 8.5 asks
you to represent the time in class Time2 of Fig. 8.5 as the number of seconds since midnight and show that indeed no change is visible to the clients of the class.)


#### Software Engineering Observation 8.3
Classes simplify programming, because the client can use only a class’s public methods.
Such methods are usually client oriented rather than implementation oriented. Clients are
neither aware of, nor involved in, a class’s implementation. Clients generally care about
what the class does but not how the class does it.


#### Software Engineering Observation 8.4
Interfaces change less frequently than implementations. When an implementation changes, implementation-dependent code must change accordingly. Hiding the implementation
reduces the possibility that other program parts will become dependent on class implementation details.
