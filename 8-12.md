# 8.12 static Import

In Section 6.3, you learned about the `static` fields and methods of class `Math`. 


We access class Math’s static fields and methods by preceding each with the class name `Math` and a
dot (.). 

A `static` import declaration enables you to import the static members of a class
or interface so you can access them via their unqualified names in your class — that is, the
class name and a dot (.) are not required when using an imported static member.


### static Import Forms
A `static` import declaration has two forms — one that imports a particular static member (which is known as single static import) and one that imports all static members
of a class (known as static import on demand). 

- 2 forms:
  - import a particular static member
  - import all static members

The following syntax imports a particular static member:

```java
import static packageName.ClassName.staticMemberName;
```

where `packageName` is the package of the class (e.g., java.lang), `ClassName` is the name of
the class (e.g., Math) and `staticMemberName` is the name of the `static` field or method
(e.g., PI or abs). 

The following syntax imports all `static` members of a class:

```java
import static packageName.ClassName.*;

```
The asterisk (*) indicates that *all* static members of the specified class should be available for use in the file. 

- (*) means all 

`static` import declarations import only `static` class members. 


Regular *import* statements should be used to specify the classes used in a program.


### Demonstrating static Import


Figure 8.14 demonstrates a `static` import. 


Line 3 is a `static` import declaration, which
imports all `static` fields and methods of class `Math` from package java.lang. 

```java
import static java.lang.Math.*;
```

- import all static fields and methods of class Math from java.lang

Lines 9–12 access the Math class’s `static` fields E (line 11) and PI (line 12) and the `static` methods `sqrt` (line 9) and `ceil` (line 10) without preceding the field names or method names with class name Math and a dot.

- we wouldn't need to use className.methodName if we import the static name

```java
// Fig. 8.14: StaticImportTest.java
// Static import of Math class methods.
import static java.lang.Math.*;
public class StaticImportTest
{
    public static void main(String\[] args) {
        System.out.printf("sqrt(900.0) = %.1f%n", sqrt(900.0));
        System.out.printf("ceil(-9.8) = %.1f%n", ceil(-9.8));
        System.out.printf("E = %f%n", E);
        System.out.printf("PI = %f%n", PI);
    }
} // end class StaticImportTest
```
#### Common Programming Error 8.7
A compilation error occurs if a program attempts to import two or more classes’ static
methods that have the same signature or `static` fields that have the same name.

- if 2 static have the same name, and we both import them, we will get a compilation error
