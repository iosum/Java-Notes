# 6.4 Declaring Methods with Multiple Parameters
Methods often require more than one piece of information to perform their tasks. 

We now consider how to write your own methods with multiple parameters.

Figure 6.3 uses a method called maximum to determine and return the largest of three
double values. 

In main, lines 14–18 prompt the user to enter three double values, then
read them from the user. 

Line 21 calls method maximum (declared in lines 28–41) to determine the largest of the three values it receives as arguments. 

When method maximum returns the result to line 21, the program assigns maximum’s return value to local variable result. 

Then line 24 outputs the maximum value. 

At the end of this section, we’ll discuss the use of operator + in line 24.

```java
// Fig. 6.3: MaximumFinder.java
 // Programmer-declared method maximum with three double parameters.
 import java.util.Scanner;

public class MaximumFinder
 {
 // obtain three floating-point values and locate the maximum value
 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
 // create Scanner for input from command window
 Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
// prompt for and input three floating-point values
    System.out.print(
    "Enter three floating-point values separated by spaces: ");
    double number1 = input.nextDouble(); // read first double
    double number2 = input.nextDouble(); // read second double
    double number3 = input.nextDouble(); // read third double
    // determine the maximum value
    // display maximum value
    System.out.println( double result = maximum(number1, number2, number3);
"Maximum is: " + result);
    }
} // end class MaximumFinder
// returns the maximum of its three double parameters
public static double maximum(double x, double y, double z)
{
    double maximumValue = x; // assume x is the largest to start
    // determine whether y is greater than maximumValue
    if (y > maximumValue)
        maximumValue = y;
    // determine whether z is greater than maximumValue
    if (z > maximumValue)
        maximumValue = z;
    return maximumValue;
}
```

### The public and static Keywords
Method maximum’s declaration begins with keyword ```public``` to indicate that the method is
“available to the public”—it can be called from methods of other classes. 

public : 外面的人可以用

---

The keyword ```static``` enables the main method (another static method) to call maximum as shown in
line 21 without qualifying the method name with the class name MaximumFinder—static
methods in the same class can call each other directly. 

static: 可以透過 className 呼叫，如果是自己在裡面呼叫，就可以不用加 className

---

Any other class that uses maximum must fully qualify the method name with the class name.

---

### Method maximum
Consider maximum’s declaration (lines 28–41). 


Line 28 indicates that it returns a double value, that the method’s name is maximum and that the method requires three double parameters (x, y and z) to accomplish its task. 

Multiple parameters are specified as a comma-separated list. 


When maximum is called from line 21, the parameters x, y and z are initialized with copies
of the values of arguments number1, number2 and number3, respectively. 

maximum 被呼叫的時候， parameters 會被 initialized with copies of the value of argument (會被 copy value放到 number1, number2, number3)

---

There must be one argument in the method call for each parameter in the method declaration. 


---

Also, each argument must be consistent with the type of the corresponding parameter. 

data type 要一致

---

For example, a parameter of type double can receive values like 7.35, 22 or –0.03456, but not Strings like "hello" nor the boolean values true or false. 

Section 6.7 discusses the argument types that can be provided in a method call for each parameter of a primitive type.

To determine the maximum value, we begin with the assumption that parameter x
contains the largest value, so line 30 declares local variable ```maximumValue``` and initializes it
with the value of parameter x. 

假設 x 是最大的 value, 所以宣告區域變數 ```maximumValue``` 然後初始化，把 x 的 value copy, 並放進 ```maximumValue```

---

Of course, it’s possible that parameter y or z contains the
actual largest value, so we must compare each of these values with ```maximumValue```. 

y,z 裡面都有可能含有最大的值，所以要跟```maximumValue```比較

---

The if statement at lines 33–34 determines whether y is greater than ```maximumValue```. 

If so, line 34 assigns y to maximumValue. 

如果 y > ```maximumValue```

y 就變成最大的數字，並把 y assign 給 ```maximumValue``` 

---


The if statement at lines 37–38 determines whether z is greater than maximumValue. 

If so, line 38 assigns z to maximumValue. 

如果 z > ```maximumValue```

z 就變成最大的數字，並把 z assign 給 ```maximumValue``` 


----

At this point the largest of the three values resides in ```maximumValue```, so line 40 returns that value to line 21.

現在可以知道 ```maximumValue``` 是最大的，所以 return

---

When program control returns to the point in the program where maximum was called,
maximum’s parameters x, y and z no longer exist in memory.

當 return 的時候， x,y,z 就不存在 memory 裡面

---

#### Software Engineering Observation 6.5
Methods can return at most one value, but the returned value could be a reference to an
object that contains many values.

method 只可以 return 一個 value, 但是那個 value 可以是 object，那 object 裡面可以有很多 values

---

#### Software Engineering Observation 6.6
Variables should be declared as fields only if they’re required for use in more than one method
of the class or if the program should save their values between calls to the class’s methods.

???

### Implementing Method maximum by Reusing Method Math.max
The entire body of our maximum method could also be implemented with two calls to
Math.max, as follows:

```
return Math.max(x, Math.max(y, z));
```
The first call to Math.max specifies arguments x and Math.max(y, z). 

Before any method can be called, its arguments must be evaluated to determine their values. 

If an argument is a method call, the method call must be performed to determine its return value. 

So, in the preceding statement, Math.max(y, z) is evaluated to determine the maximum of y and z.

Then the result is passed as the second argument to the other call to Math.max, which returns the larger of its two arguments. 

This is a good example of software reuse—we find the largest of three values by reusing Math.max, which finds the larger of two values. 

Note how concise this code is compared to lines 30–38 of Fig. 6.3.

### Assembling Strings with String Concatenation
Java allows you to assemble String objects into larger strings by using operators + or +=.

This is known as string concatenation. 

When both operands of operator + are String objects, operator + creates a new String object in which the characters of the right operand
are placed at the end of those in the left operand—e.g., the expression "hello " + "there"
creates the String "hello there".

In line 24 of Fig. 6.3, the expression "Maximum is: " + result uses operator + with
operands of types String and double. 

Every primitive value and object in Java can be represented as a String. 

每一個原生的 data type 都可以變成 String

---

When one of the + operator’s operands is a String, the other is converted to a String, then the two are concatenated. 

In line 24, the double value is converted to its String representation and placed at the end of the String "Maximum is: ". 

If there are any trailing zeros in a double value, these will be discarded when the number is converted to a String—for example 9.3500 would be represented as 9.35.

如果小數後面是 0, 變成 string 會直接砍掉

---

Primitive values used in String concatenation are converted to Strings. 

A boolean concatenated with a String is converted to the String "true" or "false". 

All objects have a ```toString``` method that returns a String representation of the object.  

所有的 object 可以用 toString 讓 object return 成 data type string 

---

When an object is concatenated with a String, the
object’s ```toString``` method is implicitly called to obtain the String representation of the
object. 

Method toString also can be called explicitly.

You can break large String literals into several smaller Strings and place them on
multiple lines of code for readability. 

In this case, the Strings can be reassembled using concatenation.
