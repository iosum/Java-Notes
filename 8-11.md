# 8.11 static Class Members

Every object has its own copy of all the instance variables of the class. 

- every object has its own copy of all the instance variable


In certain cases, only one copy of a particular variable should be shared by all objects of a class.

- ONE copy of a variable is shared by all objects

A ```static``` field— called a class variable—is used in such cases.

- for example: ```static```


A static variable represents classwide information—all objects of the class share the same piece of data. 

- static variable: all objects share the same data


The declaration of a static variable begins with the keyword ```static```.


### Motivating static
Let’s motivate static data with an example. 

Suppose that we have a video game with Martians and other space creatures. 



Each Martian tends to be brave and willing to attack other
space creatures when the Martian is aware that at least four other Martians are present. 

- when the number of Martians are greater than 4, Martians will be brave


If fewer than five Martians are present, each of them becomes cowardly. 


Thus, each Martian needs to know the `martianCount`. 


We could endow class Martian with ```martianCount``` as an instance variable. 

- create a instance variable called `martianCount`

If we do this, then every Martian will have a separate copy of the instance variable, and every time we create a new Martian, we’ll have to update the instance variable `martianCount` in every Martian object. 

- every Martian will have a copy of the `martianCount`
- every time we create
- we need to update `martianCount`

This wastes space with the redundant copies, wastes time in updating the separate copies and is error prone. 




Instead, we declare `martianCount` to be static, making `martianCount` classwide data. 

- we declare `martianCount` to be static

Every Martian can see the `martianCount` as if it were an instance variable of class Martian, but only one copy of the static `martianCount` is maintained. 

- only 1 copy of the static `martianCount`
- every Martian can see the `martianCount`


This saves space. 


We save time by having the Martian constructor increment the static `martianCount`—there’s only one copy, so we do not have to increment separate copies for each Martian object.

### Software Engineering Observation 8.9
Use a ```static``` variable when all objects of a class **must use the same copy of the variable**.


### Class Scope
```Static``` variables have class scope—they can be used in all of the class’s methods. 

- `static` variable can be used in all class's methods

We can access a class’s `public` `static` members through a reference to any object of the class, or by
qualifying the member name with the class name and a dot (.), as in Math.random(). 

- we can access a public, static members 
  - by getting a reference to an object
  - by `ClassName.methodName`
  - Math.pow()

A class’s `private` `static` class members can be accessed by client code only through methods
of the class. 

- a private static member
- can only be accessed by its' clients

Actually, `static` class members exist even when no objects of the class exist—
they’re available as soon as the class is loaded into memory at execution time. 

- static members will always exist
- no matter there is an object in a class


To access a `public` `static` member when no objects of the class exist (and even when they do), prefix
the class name and a dot (.) to the `static` member, as in `Math.PI`. 

- `public` `static` example:
  - Math.PI


To access a `private` `static` member when no objects of the class exist, provide a public static method and call it by qualifying its name with the class name and a dot.

- private static example:
  - `ClassName.methodName`


### Software Engineering Observation 8.10
`Static` class variables and methods exist, and can be used, even if no objects of that class
have been instantiated.


### static Methods Cannot Directly Access Instance Variables and Instance Methods

A `static` method cannot access a class’s instance variables and instance methods, because
a `static` method can be called even when no objects of the class have been instantiated.

- a static method cannot access instance variables an method
- because a static method can be called through no objects 



For the same reason, the `this` reference cannot be used in a static method. 

- `this` cannot be used in a `static` method

The `this` reference must refer to a specific object of the class, and when a static method is called, there
might not be any objects of its class in memory.

- `this` : a specific object
- there might not be any object when a static method is called

### Common Programming Error 8.5
A compilation error occurs if a `static` method calls an instance method in the same class by using only the method name. 

Similarly, a compilation error occurs if a `static` method
attempts to access an instance variable in the same class by using only the variable name.


### Common Programming Error 8.6
Referring to `this` in a static method is a compilation error.



### Tracking the Number of Employee Objects That Have Been Created
Our next program declares two classes — `Employee` (Fig. 8.12) and `EmployeeTest`
(Fig. 8.13). 

Class `Employee` declares `private` `static` variable count (Fig. 8.12, line 7) and
`public` `static` method `getCount` (lines 36–39). 

```java
private static int count = 0; // number of Employees created
```

```java
// static method to get static count value
public static int getCount()
{
    return count;
}
```

The `static` variable count maintains a
count of the number of objects of class `Employee` that have been created so far. 



This class variable is initialized to zero in line 7. 

```java
private static int count = 0; // number of Employees created
```



If a `static` variable is not initialized, the compiler
assigns it a default value — in this case 0, the default value for type int.

- `static` variable;  // 0

```java
// Fig. 8.12: Employee.java
// static variable used to maintain a count of the number of
// Employee objects in memory.
public class Employee
{
    private static int count = 0; // number of Employees created
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    // initialize Employee, add 1 to static count and
    // output String indicating that constructor was called
    public Employee(String firstName, String lastName)
    {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        ++count; // increment static count of employees

        System.out.printf("Employee constructor: %s %s; count = %d%n",
        firstName, lastName, count);
    }
    // get first name
    public String getFirstName()
    {
        return firstName;
    }
    // get last name
    public String getLastName()
    {
        return lastName;
    }
    // static method to get static count value
    public static int getCount()
    {
        return count;
    }
}
```

When `Employee` objects exist, variable `count` can be used in any method of an
`Employee` object—this example increments count in the constructor (line 18). 

- `count` can be used in any method of an `Employee` object

```java
++count; // increment static count of employees
```

The `public` `static` method `getCount` (lines 36–39) returns the number of `Employee` objects that have
been created so far. 

```java
// static method to get static count value
public static int getCount()
{
    return count;
}
```

When no objects of class `Employee` exist, client code can access variable `count` by calling method `getCount` via the class name, as in `Employee.getCount()`. 

- without any object
- still can use the method `getCount`
- to get the number of employee

When objects exist, method `getCount` can also be called via any reference to an Employee object.

- when objects exist
- `getCount` can be called via reference 

#### Good Programming Practice 8.1
Invoke every `static` method by using the class name and a dot (.) to emphasize that the
method being called is a `static` method.


### Class EmployeeTest
`EmployeeTest` method main (Fig. 8.13) instantiates two Employee objects (lines 13–14).

```java
// create two Employees; count should be 2
Employee e1 = new Employee("Susan", "Baker");
Employee e2 = new Employee("Bob", "Blue");
```


When each Employee object’s constructor is invoked, lines 15–16 of Fig. 8.12 assign the
Employee’s first name and last name to instance variables `firstName` and `lastName`. 

```java
this.firstName = firstName;
this.lastName = lastName;
```


These two statements do not make copies of the original `String` arguments. 

- there is no copy 

Actually, `String` objects in Java are **immutable** — they cannot be modified after they’re created. 



Therefore, it’s safe to have many references to one String object. 

- String can have many references to 1 String object

This is not normally the case for objects of most other classes in Java. 


If `String` objects are immutable, you might wonder why
we’re able to use operators + and += to concatenate String objects. 

String-concatenation actually results in a new `String` object containing the concatenated values. 

- concatenation will create a new `String` object

The original String objects are not modified.


```java
// Fig. 8.13: EmployeeTest.java
// static member demonstration.
public class EmployeeTest
{
    public static void main(String\[] args)
    {
        // show that count is 0 before creating Employees
        System.out.printf("Employees before instantiation: %d%n" ,Employee.getCount());
        // create two Employees; count should be 2
        Employee e1 = new Employee("Susan", "Baker");
        Employee e2 = new Employee("Bob", "Blue");
        // show that count is 2 after creating two Employees
        System.out.printf("%nEmployees after instantiation:%n");
        System.out.printf("via e1.getCount(): %d%n", e1.getCount());
        System.out.printf("via Employee.getCount(): %d%n", Employee.getCount());
        // get names of Employees
        System.out.printf("%nEmployee 1: %s %s%nEmployee 2: %s %s%n",
        e1.getFirstName(), e1.getLastName(),
        e2.getFirstName(), e2.getLastName());
    }
} // end class EmployeeTest
```
When main terminates, local variables `e1` and `e2` are discarded—remember that a local
variable exists only until the block in which it’s declared completes execution. 

- main terminates
- e1 and e2 disappear


Because `e1`
and `e2` were the only references to the Employee objects created in lines 13–14 (Fig. 8.13),
these objects become “eligible for garbage collection” as main terminates.

- because e1 and e2 were references
- e1 and e2 are eligible for garbage collection



In a typical app, the garbage collector might eventually reclaim the memory for any objects that are eligible for collection. 

- the garbage collector will take back the memory 


If any objects are not reclaimed before the program
terminates, the operating system will reclaim the memory used by the program. 

- or the OS will take back the memory


The JVM does not guarantee when, or even whether, the garbage collector will execute. 

- JVM does NOT no when the garbage collector will execute

When it does, it’s possible that no objects or only a subset of the eligible objects will be collected.
