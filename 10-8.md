# 10.8 A Deeper Explanation of Issues with Calling Methods from Constructors

Do not call overridable methods from constructors. 

- 不要在 constructor 裡面 call 被 override 的 method

When creating a subclass object, this
could lead to an overridden method being called before the subclass object is fully initialized.

- 因為 subclass object 可能還沒被 initialized, 但是 method 已經被 called

Recall that when you construct a subclass object, its constructor first calls one of the
direct superclass’s constructors. 

- 因為 constructor 永遠是寫在前面的


If the superclass constructor calls an overridable method, the
subclass’s version of that method will be called by the superclass constructor—before the subclass constructor’s body has a chance to execute. 


This could lead to subtle, difficult-todetect errors if the subclass method that was called depends on initialization that has not
yet been performed in the subclass constructor’s body.


It’s acceptable to call a `static` method from a constructor. 

- 但是在 constructor 裡面 static method 是可行的

For example, a constructor
and a set method often perform the same validation for a particular instance variable. 


If the
validation code is brief, it’s acceptible to duplicate it in the constructor and the set method.

If lengthier validation is required, define a static validation method (typically a private
helper method) then call it from the constructor and the set method. 


It’s also acceptable
for a constructor to call a `final` instance method, provided that the method does not
directly or indirectly call an overridable instance method.

- constructor 也可以 call a `final` method, 只要不是 override 的 method 就可以
