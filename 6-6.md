# Method-Call Stack and Stack Frames

To understand how Java performs method calls, we first need to consider a data structure
(i.e., collection of related data items) known as a ```stack```. 

You can think of a stack as analogous to a pile of dishes. 

stack 可以很像一疊盤子

When a dish is placed on the pile, it’s normally placed at the top
(referred to as pushing the dish onto the stack). 

如果要放盤子，就要把盤子放在上面


Similarly, when a dish is removed from the pile, it’s normally removed from the top (referred to as ```popping``` the dish off the stack).

當要拿比較底下的盤子時，就要把上面的先拿掉

Stacks are known as **last-in, first-out (LIFO)** data structures — the last item pushed onto
the stack is the first item popped from the stack.

stacks 是最後的進去，但是最後進去的先出來


When a program calls a method, the called method must know how to return to its
caller, so the return address of the calling method is pushed onto the method-call stack. 

當 a program 呼叫一個 method, 被呼叫的 method 一定要知道怎麼 return 值給 its caller, 所以回傳 calling method 的地址會被 push 到 method-call stack

If a series of method calls occurs, the successive return addresses are pushed onto the stack in
last-in, first-out order so that each method can return to its caller.

當一系列的 method 呼叫發生，會有連續 return addresses 被 pushed 到 stack 裡面，那麼每一個 method 可以 return 值給 caller

The method-call stack also contains the memory for the local variables (including the
method parameters) used in each invocation of a method during a program’s execution.

method-call stack 包含可以存 local variables 的 memory, 包括 method 參數


This data, stored as a portion of the method-call stack, is known as the stack frame (or
activation record) of the method call. 

這樣的資料叫做 stack frame


When a method call is made, the stack frame for that method call is pushed onto the method-call stack. 

當 method call 被做出來時， 在 stack frame 的那一些資料會被 push 到 method-call stack

When the method returns to its caller, the stack frame for this method call is popped off the stack and those local variables are no longer known to the program. 

當 method return 給 caller 時， stack frame for this method call 會被 pop off the stack, 然後這一些區域變數就不會存在了

If a local variable holding a reference to an object is
the only variable in the program with a reference to that object, then, when the stack frame
containing that local variable is popped off the stack, the object can no longer be accessed
by the program and will eventually be deleted from memory by the JVM during garbage
collection, which we discuss in Section 8.10.

假設現在有 local variable 有拿到 object 的 reference , 那麼這一個 local variable 被 pop 的時候，object 就不會存在，最後會從 memory delete 


Of course, a computer’s memory is finite, so only a certain amount can be used to
store stack frames on the method-call stack. 

因為 computer 的記憶體是有限的，所以只有一定數量的 stack frames 存在 method-call stack


If more method calls occur than can have their stack frames stored, an error known as a stack overflow occurs—we’ll talk more about this in Chapter 11, Exception Handling: A Deeper Look.

假如很多 method calls 發生導致 memory 無法負荷時，會導致 stack overflow, 通常會發生在 recursion 的時候


java 會寫下下一行要執行的行數(reference), 而不是當時 call method 的行數(reference), 假如現在 method call 在第 4 行, 會記錄第 5 行到 method call stack.
