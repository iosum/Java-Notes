# 6.8 Java API Packages

As you’ve seen, Java contains many predefined classes that are grouped into categories of
related classes called packages. 

之前寫好的 classes 叫做 packages

Together, these are known as the Java Application Programming Interface (Java API), or the Java class library. 

packegs + 很多 packages = Java API

A great strength of Java is the Java API’s thousands of classes. 


The set of packages available in Java is quite large. 

In addition to those summarized in Fig. 6.5, Java includes packages for complex graphics, advanced graphical user interfaces, printing, advanced networking, security, database processing, multimedia, accessibility (for people with disabilities), concurrent programming, cryptography, XML
processing and many other capabilities.
