# 8.8 Composition

A class can have references to objects of other classes as members. 

-   一個 class 裡面有別的 class 的 object 的 reference

This is called composition and is sometimes referred to as a has-a relationship. 

-   這叫做 composition

For example, an `AlarmClock` object needs to know the current time and the time when it’s supposed to sound its alarm, so it’s reasonable to include two references to Time objects in an `AlarmClock` object. 

-   以時間舉例, 需要一個 current time 跟鬧鐘要叫的時間

A car has-a steering wheel, a break pedal and an accelerator pedal.

-   以車子來說, 要有煞車跟油門

### Class Date

This composition example contains classes Date (Fig. 8.7), Employee (Fig. 8.8) and EmployeeTest (Fig. 8.9). 

Class `Date` (Fig. 8.7) declares instance variables month, day and
year (lines 6–8) to represent a date. 

```java
private int month; // 1-12
private int day; // 1-31 based on month
private int year; // any year
```

The constructor receives three int parameters. 

```java
// constructor: confirm proper value for month and day given the year
public Date(int month, int day, int year)
// check if month in range
    if (month <= 0 || month > 12)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("month (" + month + ") must be 1-12");
    // check if day in range for month
    if (day <= 0 || (day > daysPerMonth[month] && !(month == 2 && day == 29)))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("day (" + day +") out-of-range for the specified month and year");
    // check for leap year if month is 2 and day is 29
    if (month == 2 && day == 29 && !(year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("day (" + day + ") out-of-range for the specified month and year");
    this.month = month;
    this.day = day;
    this.year = year;
    System.out.printf("Date object constructor for date %s%n", this);
}
```

Lines 17–19 validate the month—if it’s out-of-range, lines 18–19 throw an exception. 

```java
// check if month in range
    if (month <= 0 || month > 12)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("month (" + month + ") must be 1-12");
```

Lines 22–25 validate the day. 

```java
// check if day in range for month
    if (day <= 0 || (day > daysPerMonth[month] && !(month == 2 && day == 29)))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("day (" + day +") out-of-range for the specified month and year");
```

If the day is incorrect based on the number of days in the particular
month (except February 29th which requires special testing for leap years), lines 24–25
throw an exception. 

-   這邊有多一個 2/29 的判斷

Lines 28–31 perform the leap year testing for February. 

```java
    // check for leap year if month is 2 and day is 29
    if (month == 2 && day == 29 && !(year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0)))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("day (" + day + ") out-of-range for the specified month and year");
```

-   判斷是不是閏年

If the month is February and the day is 29 and the year is not a leap year, lines 30–31 throw an exception. 

If no exceptions are thrown, then lines 33–35 initialize the Date’s instance variables
and lines 38–38 output the `this` reference as a String. 

```java
this.month = month;
this.day = day;
this.year = year;
```

-   沒有 exception, 就會 intialize the Date's instance variable

```java
System.out.printf(
"Date object constructor for date %s%n", this);
```

-   上面的 `this` 的 data type 是 String

Since `this` is a reference to the
current Date object, the object’s `toString` method (lines 42–45) is called implicitly to obtain the object’s String representation.

-   因為 this 是 a reference to the Date object, 所以可以用 object's `toString` method

In this example, we assume that the value for year
is correct—an industrial-strength Date class should also validate the year.

### Class Employee

Class `Employee` (Fig. 8.8) has instance variables `firstName`, `lastName`, `birthDate` and `hireDate`. 

Members `firstName` and `lastName` are references to String objects. 

Members `birthDate` and `hireDate` are references to Date objects. 

This demonstrates that a class can
have as instance variables references to objects of other classes. 

-   這個 class 表示在同一個 class 可以有 2 種不同的 classes, 一個是 String, 一個是 Date

The Employee constructor (lines 12–19) takes four parameters representing the first name, last name, birth date and hire date. 

The objects referenced by the parameters are assigned to the Employee object’s
instance variables. 

When class Employee’s `toString` method is called, it returns a `String`
containing the employee’s name and the String representations of the two Date objects.

-   當 `toString` 被呼叫, 會 return 一個 String, 這一個 String 會包含 employee’s name 還有 two Date objects
    (這 2 個 Date object 已經被 cast 成 String)

Each of these Strings is obtained with an implicit call to the `Date` class’s `toString` method

```java
// Fig. 8.8: Employee.java
// Employee class with references to other objects.
public class Employee
{
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private Date birthDate;
    private Date hireDate;
// constructor to initialize name, birth date and hire date
public Employee(String firstName, String lastName, Date birthDate, Date hireDate)
{
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
    this.birthDate = birthDate;
    this.hireDate = hireDate;
}
// convert Employee to String format
public String toString()
{
    return String.format("%s, %s Hired: %s Birthday: %s", lastName, firstName, hireDate, birthDate);
}
// end class Employee
```

### Class EmployeeTest

Class `EmployeeTest` (Fig. 8.9) creates two Date objects to represent an Employee’s birthday and hire date, respectively. 

Line 10 creates an `Employee` and initializes its instance variables by passing to the constructor two Strings (representing the Employee’s first and last
names) and two Date objects (representing the birthday and hire date). 

Line 12 implicitly
invokes the Employee’s `toString` method to display the values of its instance variables and
demonstrate that the object was initialized properly.

```java
System.out.println(employee);
```

```java
// Fig. 8.9: EmployeeTest.java
// Composition demonstration.
public class EmployeeTest
{
    public static void main(String\[] args)
    {
        Date birth = new Date(7, 24, 1949);
        Date hire = new Date(3, 12, 1988);
        Employee employee = new Employee("Bob", "Blue", birth, hire);
        System.out.println(employee);
    }
} // end class EmployeeTest
```
