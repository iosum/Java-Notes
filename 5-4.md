# Example using the for statement

The following examples show techniques for varying the control variable in a for statement. 

In each case, we write only the appropriate for header. 

Note the change in the relational operator for the loops that decrement the control variable.


a) Vary the control variable from 1 to 100 in increments of 1.

```
for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++)
```

b) Vary the control variable from 100 to 1 in decrements of 1.

```
for (int i = 100; i >= 1; i--)
```

c) Vary the control variable from 7 to 77 in increments of 7.

```
for (int i = 7; i <= 77; i += 7)
```

d) Vary the control variable from 20 to 2 in decrements of 2.

```
for (int i = 20; i >= 2; i -= 2)
```

e) Vary the control variable over the values 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20.

```
for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 3)
```

f) Vary the control variable over the values 99, 88, 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, 11, 0.

```
for (int i = 99; i >= 0; i -= 11)
```


Application: Summing the Even Integers from 2 to 20
We now consider two sample applications that demonstrate simple uses of for. 

The application in Fig. 5.5 uses a for statement to sum the even integers from 2 to 20 and store
the result in an int variable called total.



### Application: Summing the Even Integers from 2 to 20

We now consider two sample applications that demonstrate simple uses of for. 

The application in Fig. 5.5 uses a for statement to sum the even integers from 2 to 20 and store
the result in an int variable called total.

```java
public class Sum{
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        int total = 0;
        for(int number = 2; number <= 20; number +=2){
            total += number;
        }
        System.out.printf("Sum is %d%n", total);
    }
}
```


The initialization and increment expressions can be comma-separated lists that enable
you to use multiple initialization expressions or multiple increment expressions. 

For example, although this is discouraged, you could merge the body of the for statement in
lines 11–12 of Fig. 

5.5 into the increment portion of the for header by using a comma as follows:

```java
for (int number = 2; number <= 20; total += number, number += 2)
; // empty statement
```

可以把最後的 total += number 寫到最後一格，並用逗號隔開，但是並不建議這麼寫

### Application: Compound-Interest Calculations

Let’s use the for statement to compute compound interest. 

Consider the following problem:

A person invests $1,000 in a savings account yielding 5% interest. 

用java寫複利, 一開始有1000, 每年 5%利率

--

Assuming that all the interest is left on deposit, calculate and print the amount of money in the account at the end of each year for 10 years. 

複利10年

---


Use the following formula to determine the
amounts:

a = p (1 + r)n

where p is the original amount invested (i.e., the principal)

r is the annual interest rate (e.g., use 0.05 for 5%)

n is the number of years

a is the amount on deposit at the end of the nth year.

The solution to this problem (Fig. 5.6) involves a loop that performs the indicated calculation for each of the 10 years the money remains on deposit. 

求 10 年後的總金額

--

Lines 8–10 in method main declare double variables amount, principal and rate, and initialize principal to 1000.0 and rate to 0.05. 

Java treats floating-point constants like 1000.0 and 0.05 as type double. 

有小數點，java都視為 double

--

Similarly, Java treats whole-number constants like 7 and -22 as type int.



---


```java
// Compound-interest calculations with for.
public class Interest {
    public static void main(String [] args) {
        double amount; // amount on deposit at end of each year
        double principal = 1000;// initial amount before interest
        double rate = 0.05; // interest rate

        System.out.printf("%s %n", "Year", "Amount on deposit");

        // calculate amount on deposit for each of ten years
        for(int year = 1; year <=10; ++year) {
            // calculate new amount for specified year
            amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year);
            // display the year and the amount
            System.out.printf("%4d%,20.2f%n", year, amount);
        
        }

    }
}

```

---


### Formatting Strings with Field Widths and Justification
Line 13 outputs the headers for two columns of output. 

```java
System.out.printf("%s %n", "Year", "Amount on deposit");
```

The first column displays the year and the second column the amount on deposit at the end of that year. 

第1個顯示年，第二個顯示有多少金額

---

We use the format specifier %20s to output the String "Amount on Deposit". 

The integer 20 between the % and the conversion character s indicates that the value should be displayed with a field
width of 20 — that is, printf displays the value with at least 20 character positions. 

printf顯示至少20個character的value

---

If the value to be output is less than 20 character positions wide (17 characters in this example), the value is right justified in the field by default. 

If the year value to be output were more than four character positions wide, the field width would be extended to the right to
accommodate the entire value—this would push the amount field to the right, upsetting the neat columns of our tabular output. 

To output values left justified, simply precede the
field width with the minus sign (–) formatting flag (e.g., %-20s).

---

### Performing the Interest Calculations with static Method pow of Class Math

The for statement (lines 16–23) executes its body 10 times, varying control variable year from 1 to 10 in increments of 1.

```java
for (int year = 1; year <= 10; ++year) {
    // calculate new amount for specified year
    amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year);
    // display the year and the amount
    System.out.printf("%4d%,20.2f%n", year, amount);
}
```

執行 loop body 10 次，每次增加1

--

This loop terminates when year becomes 11. (Variable
year represents n in the problem statement.)

11 時候會終止

---

Classes provide methods that perform common tasks on objects. In fact, most methods must be called on a specific object. 

大部分的 method都會被call到

---

For example, to output text in Fig. 5.6, line 13 calls method printf on the System.out object. 

這裡就 call method printf 的 System.out object

```java
System.out.printf("%s %n", "Year", "Amount on deposit");
```

---

Some classes also provide methods that perform common tasks and do not require you to first create objects of those classes. 

These are called static methods. 

static method 只會 perform common tasks，且並不需要create object

---

For example, Java does not include an exponentiation operator, so the designers of Java’s Math class defined static method pow for raising a value to a power. 

java 並沒有 include 指數運算，但是設計 java math class 的人 define static method pow, 所以只要直接 call 就可以前面不用再加甚麼object

---

You can call a static method by specifying the class name followed by a dot (.) and the method name, as in

```
ClassName.methodName(arguments)
```


---

In Chapter 6, you’ll learn how to implement static methods in your own classes.

We use static method pow of class Math to perform the compound-interest calculation in Fig. 5.6. 

Math.pow(x, y) calculates the value of x raised to the yth power. 

Math.pow(x, y) 計算出 x的y次方

---

The method receives two double arguments and returns a double value. 

會收到 2個 double arguments 然後 return 一個 double value

---

Line 19 performs the calculation a = p(1 + r)n, where a is amount, p is principal, r is rate and n is year. 

```
amount = principal * Math.pow(1.0 + rate, year);
```

---

Class Math is defined in package java.lang, so you do not need to import class Math to use it.

Math 已經在 java.lang 的 package 中，不用再另外 import

---

The body of the for statement contains the calculation 1.0 + rate, which appears as an argument to the Math.pow method. 

In fact, this calculation produces the same result
each time through the loop, so repeating it in every iteration of the loop is wasteful.



---

### Formatting Floating-Point Numbers
After each calculation, line 22 outputs the year and the amount on deposit at the end of that year. 

```java
System.out.printf("%4d%,20.2f%n", year, amount);
```

The year is output in a field width of four characters (as specified by %4d). 

位數為4

---

The amount is output as a floating-point number with the format specifier %,20.2f. 

The comma (,) formatting flag indicates that the floating-point value should be output with a grouping separator. 

The actual separator used is specific to the user’s locale (i.e., country).

For example, in the United States, the number will be output using commas to separate every three digits and a decimal point to separate the fractional part of the number, as in
1,234.45. 

The number 20 in the format specification indicates that the value should be output right justified in a field width of 20 characters. 

number 20 = 20位數

---

The .2 specifies the formatted number’s precision—in this case, the number is rounded to the nearest hundredth and output
with two digits to the right of the decimal point.

.2 = 小數點後2位

---

### A Warning about Displaying Rounded Values

We declared variables amount, principal and rate to be of type double in this example.

We’re dealing with fractional parts of dollars and thus need a type that allows decimal points in its values. 

表示小數的地方要用 double 要處理

---

Unfortunately, floating-point numbers can cause trouble. 

但是浮點數會有問題

---

Here’s a simple explanation of what can go wrong when using double (or float) to represent dollar amounts (assuming that dollar amounts are displayed with two digits to the right of the
decimal point): 

Two double dollar amounts stored in the machine could be 14.234
(which would normally be rounded to 14.23 for display purposes) and 18.673 (which would normally be rounded to 18.67 for display purposes). 

2個 double 互相相加會出現問題

---


When these amounts are added, they produce the internal sum 32.907,which would normally be rounded to 32.91 for display purposes.


Thus, your output could appear as

```
  14.23
+ 18.67
 -------
  32.91
```

but a person adding the individual numbers as displayed would expect the sum to be
32.90. You’ve been warned!
