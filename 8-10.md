# 8.10 Garbage Collection

Every object uses system resources, such as memory. 


We need a disciplined way to give
resources back to the system when they’re no longer needed; 


otherwise, “resource leaks”
might occur that would prevent resources from being reused by your program or possibly by other programs. 


The JVM performs automatic garbage collection to reclaim the memory occupied by objects that are no longer used. 

- JVM performs automatic garbage collection
- reclaim the memeory
- the memory is occupies by objects
- objects are not longer used

When there are no more references to an
object, the object is eligible to be collected. 

- no more reference 
- the object needs to be collected


Collection typically occurs when the JVM executes its garbage collector, which may not happen for a while, or even at all before a program terminates. 

- collection happens
  - JVM executes garbage collector
  - may or may not happen


So, memory leaks that are common in other languages like C and C++
(because memory is not automatically reclaimed in those languages) are less likely in Java,
but some can still happen in subtle ways. 

- memory leaks are common in c 
- but is not common is java


Resource leaks other than memory leaks can also
occur. 

- resource leaks happens

For example, an app may open a file on disk to modify its contents—if the app does
not close the file, it must terminate before any other app can use the file.

- an app open a file to modify the contents
  - if it does NOT close the file
  - MUST TERMINATE



### A Note about Class Object’s finalize Method
Every class in Java has the methods of class Object (package java.lang), one of which is
method ```finalize```. 

- every class has the methods of class object
- and one of the methods is finalize

(You’ll learn more about class Object in Chapter 9.) 


You should never use method finalize, because it can cause many problems and there’s uncertainty as to
whether it will ever get called before a program terminates.

- NEVER USE finalize

The original intent of finalize was to allow the garbage collector to perform termination housekeeping on an object just before reclaiming the object’s memory. 

- original intent was to allow the garbage collector to perform termination on an object

Now, it’s
considered better practice for any class that uses system resources—such as files on disk—
to provide a method that programmers can call to release resources when they’re no longer
needed in a program. 

- better pratice is to use system resources to provide a method manually

```AutoClosable``` objects reduce the likelihood of resource leaks when
you use them with the try-with-resources statement. 



As its name implies, an ```AutoClosable``` object is closed automatically, once a try-with-resources statement finishes using the
object. 



We discuss this in more detail in Section 11.12.
